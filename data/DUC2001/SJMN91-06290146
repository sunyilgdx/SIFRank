<LEADPARA>  As the climactic votes that put her son on the Supreme Court were cast
hundreds of miles away in Washington, Leola Williams jumped from her chair,
hugged a neighbor and then began to sing a spiritual, "Jesus Keep Me Near the
Cross.";   Never had she doubted the outcome, Williams said a short time
later. "I didn't give my child up and I never would," she said. Then she
excused herself to place a phone call to her son, Clarence Thomas. What would
she tell him? "I love you."  </LEADPARA>

And, a reporter asked, what would she say to Anita Hill if she had the chance?;

"I'd tell her to pray," she replied. "She needs God bad. I won't say nothing bad about her because she's a mother-child, too. But, whoever put her up to it, I just pray she'll get her life straightened out.";

In Thomas' birthplace, the hometown crowd has made no attempt to disguise where its heart lies. A handwritten sign on the main thoroughfare announces: "Pinpoint Georgia, the home of Judge Clarence Thomas.";

Not surprisingly, no one here seemed to believe Hill's allegation that Thomas had sexually harassed her between 1981 and 1983 while she worked for him.;

From a roof, a sign announced: "We believe Clarence.";

Much of the community gathered before the only big-screen television available, at the home of Abraham Famble, deacon of the Sweet Fields of Eden Baptist Church, as the time for the Senate vote neared.;

Williams prayed silently in the kitchen, asking God to watch over her son as she rubbed her hands nervously. The crowd joined her in the 23rd Psalm : "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death . . .";

As the tally reached a majority for Thomas, a cry of joy and applause rang out.; "Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal," Famble said.
