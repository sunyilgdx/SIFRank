   The Agriculture Department says it has been on
top of the drought since March 1, monitoring the situation, setting
up hotlines to handle worried callers and issuing enough statements
to paper a thousand bird cages, easy.
   One of the latest informational gimmicks is a ``USDA
Backgrounder'' listing the department's ``drought-related actions''
since the blotter-like furnaces began roaring across most of the
nation.
   ``It was my idea, my memory isn't what it used to be,'' quipped
Sally Michael, the department's deputy director of information.
``This helps me keep track of what we've done.''
   Michael agreed during questioning by a reporter that the action
list is lean on actual dollars going into the drought aid. Only two
items had dollar amounts. One involved meat purchases for school
cafeterias and the other a credit deal for the sale of meat to
Mexico.
   The backgrounders will be updated every two weeks. The first
lists 22 separate drought ``actions'' by USDA or its people,
beginning more than four months ago.
   First item:
   ``March 1. Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng establishes
USDA Drought Task Force under the chairmanship of Deputy Secretary
Peter C. Myers. Members _ agency administrators and key USDA
personnel _ will constantly monitor the potential drought
situation.''
   The blurb also gave the number of the USDA press release that
formally announced the task force creation, but not its date. In
reality, though the drought panel was set up by Lyng on March 1,
the press release announcing the action was not issued until April
22.
   Department officials questioned at the time said they attached
no significance to keeping the task force secret for seven weeks
before announcing it.
   Excerpts from other USDA actions cited by the report:
   _May 31. Counties found to be suffering from drought will be
allowed emergency haying and grazing of Acreage Conservation
Reserve (ACR) and Conservation Use Acreage (CUA). At this time,
haying and grazing do not apply to Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP) acreage.
   _June 9. Standing hay on farms held in inventory (taken over) by
the Farmers Home Administration can be sold at a reasonable cost to
help feed livestock in drought counties where state offices of the
