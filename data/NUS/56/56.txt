Context-Aware Web Information Systems
Abstract
Apart from completeness usability,
performance
and maintainability are the key quality aspects for
Web information systems.
Considering usability
as key implies taking usage processes into account
right from the beginning of systems development.
Context-awareness appears as a promising idea for
increasing usability of Web Information Systems.
In the present paper we propose an approach to
context-awareness
of
Web
Information
Systems
that systematically distinguishes among the various
important kinds of context. We show how parts of
this context can be operationalized for increasing
customers' usage comfort.
Our approach permits
designing Web information systems such that they
meet high quality expectations concerning usability,
performance and maintainability.
We demonstrate
the validity of our approach by discussing the part
of a banking Web Information System dedicated to
online home-loan application.

Introduction
1.1
Generations of Web Services
Understanding Web Information Systems (WIS) as
monolithic and presentation-oriented query-answer
systems would be too simplistic. Implementing the
individual services of a WIS only on the basis of XML
or (D)HTML suites suffices for the interface accessible
by a particular customer. The quality of service
provided by a WIS both expected and implemented,
however, evolved over the last decade and has evolved
beyond mere completeness. Extending the classification
in (Berger 2003, p.146) we distinguish between
different generations of WIS.
First generation (1G): "build it, and they will come"
First develop a WIS, then customers will come,
because they believe that it is useful. Many of the
1G-WIS were informational, i.e., they weren't interactive
.
Second generation (2G): "advertise online sales, and
they will come"
Develop a WIS and market it. Customers will

come, because the advertisement convinced them
about the WIS's usability.
The WIS may be
transactional, i.e., contain interactive interfaces
to company products and services. A standard
interface is provided but hard to learn. No particular
customer usage aid is offered.
Third generation (3G): "realize a pleasant use of high
quality services, and they will come"
Customers will find using the WIS helpful. They
will do the marketing. 3G-WIS's typical characteristics
are:
· high value and up-to-date content,
· high performance,
· brand value of the provider, and
· pleasant and easy use for casual as well as
for frequent customers.
Many WIS including several banking WIS are still
2G. However, impressive and well-developed WIS,
e.g., the Amazon web-site, demonstrate the feasibil-ity
of 3G-WIS. The success of such WIS is based on
deep understanding of the application area, the customers
needs, abilities and habits. Adaptation to customers
-- if provided -- is based on allocating the
most suited subspace of the WIS application space to
the customer.
WIS can be classified into e-business, e-learning,
edutainment, community, information and personality
WIS. In the e-business class the B2B systems
have been more successful than B2C systems. This
success results from well-understood usage scenarios
built into the WIS. We observe that usage scenarios
are better understood for B2B-WIS than for B2C-WIS
.
Storyboarding is a design approach focusing on usage
scenarios. However, so far it is mainly used employing
pinboard approaches, see e.g. (Siegel 1998,
Van Duyne et al. 2003). Pinboard approaches map a
number of scenarios observed in the application onto
tree-structured web sites. Storyboarding in the movie
business is used to design much more complex scenarios
. To overcome this limitation the storyboard
specification language SiteLang has been introduced
in (Thalheim and D¨
usterh¨
oft 2001). Until now it has
been applied in more that two dozen WIS projects of
the Cottbus InfoTeam since 1999.
Our development experience implies that implementing
3G-WIS requires sophisticated database support
, see (Thalheim 2000a). Our approach to guarantee
for this support is based on the theory of media
types, which generalize database views (see e.g.
(Schewe and Thalheim 2001)). Another finding from
our practical experiences is that customer behavior
has changed. They are no more patiently waiting until
their needs are met. They require personal interfaces
. Customization of system interfaces to users is
37
known for quite a while. However, WIS are targeting
new and casual customers. These customers are not
capable or willing to arrange for system adaptation.
Internet service providers report customers frequently
complaining about insufficient user-friendliness and
unsophisticated WIS.
1.2
Problems of Complex Applications
Modern applications, in particular WIS often appear
to be relatively simple, if only their interface is considered
. Their point-and-click operating mode is de-liberately
set up in a way that causes the impression
of simplicity. Internally, however, things may be quite
different. A client-server multi-tier architecture with
HTML-server, database server and application server
might be used. This implies some non-trivial development
tasks done such as database design and development
of an application programmer interface or
similar.
In addition, several customer types may be known
to the application system. A WIS may appear very
different to customers of different type. The functionality
they access, however, is still the basic functionality
as implemented by the servers mentioned before
. Consequently as many function schemas and
data schemas need to be developed as there are anticipated
customer types. These schemas need to be integrated
to develop a consistent view of the key application
functionalities. Views that are based on these
schemas need to be generated allowing the individual
customers to operate with the application in the way
that is most natural for them. The development of
WIS thus can be a quite complex process.
Among others the complexity of this development
process depends on the degree of use of an underlying
database, from which dynamic web pages are created.
Furthermore, the complexity of this process depends
on the number of versions of usage processes of the
WIS that need to be anticipated. Since different usage
processes may lead to different data and functionality
accessible to customers. Additional complexity
comes in -- e.g. in the case of modern retail banking
-- when a requirement is set in place that various
access channels -- e.g. channels needed for cell-phone
- or PDA-access -- should be made available to
customers. Apart from the purely technical problem
arising from discretionary access channels the problem
of layout for these channels has to be solved.
1.3
An Application Example
An example of a WIS in retail banking showing a relatively
high diversity of the usage process is online
loan application, if considered in full generality as we
do it here. For an introduction to lending in general
, of which the loan business is just a part, see e.g.
(Valentine 1999). Not all banks offer online home-loan
application facilities. Those that provide such
facilities do not necessarily allow customers to deal
with them completely online. Banks that offer effective
online loan application are the Swiss UBS AG
and the New Zealand and Australia based ASB Bank.
The acceptance of a longer interruption of service at
the ASB site indicated that at least for this bank online
home-loan application is not yet considered a major
part of their business.
Complexity in home-loan applications results from
the fact that the applicant not necessarily is exactly
one natural person. For each of the applicants properties
and debts need to be identified and valuated.
Often banks would accept only home-loan applications
of at most two people, in general the couple that
is going to live in the home financed with the loan.
Complexity is further increased by the loan not necessarily
being a fresh one but being already granted
to someone who due to his or her financial conditions
has chosen to move the loan to a different bank.
Furthermore, the properties offered for securing
the loan may belong to a variety of types. Some of
these types, e.g.
real estate property may require
physical inspection to determine the value they can
cover. Other properties such as financial instruments,
i.e. shares, options or accounts, may only need an inquiry
to the respective depot or account. If cash is
a security, then it might even be impossible to finish
the process electronically, as the cash needs to be
brought to the bank branch, counted and deposited.
It is similar with debts. On real estate properties
there might be liabilities that require an assessment
of the actual value. Of course there is quite a number
of so-called loan structures (see (Valentine 1999,
p.226f.)) distinguishing between loans. For instance,
they may differ from each other in their term, frequency
of repayments, borrower's authorization to increase
the debt (e.g. overdraft facility), the minimum
security ratio or the repayment structure. The latter
addresses the schema of how capital and interests
are paid for by the customer. Independently of the
loan structure a customer might chose among several
loan options that specify how the interests develop
over time, i.e. they may be fixed for a particular time
period or they may float like general interest rates in
banking.
Apart from these principal choices in a home-loan
there are a number of tools available for customer's
use throughout online home loan applications such as
a borrowing power calculator, a repayment schedule
calculator, etc. Additionally, dictionaries of banking
terms, act excerpts and comments as well as descriptions
of the applying financial instruments need to be
accessible to customers.
All the possible options in the financial instruments
and the respective variations of the WIS usage
will only be considered by a small number of customers
. In more technical terms we have to deal with
a generic process type. Most of its instances realize
only a part of the possible variations. At present online
home-loan application systems are not typical retail
banking applications. Automated clearing house
(ACH), i.e. direct deposit of payments, withdrawing
monthly mortgage payments, etc. are more typical.
According to (Berger 2003, p.150f.) its use in the
US is steeply increasing and has after starting problems
even increased productivity. However, ACH is
a back-office activity, whereas online home-loan application
is a customer-home or front-office activity.
According to (Berger 2003, p.149) internet-only banks
performed more poorly than conventional banks did.
If this finding implies that online home-loan applications
are less productive than conventional home-loan
application processing then we believe that this is
only a temporary phenomenon. We believe that cultural
obstacles concerning internet-banking will disappear
when 3G-WIS have become more popular.
According to (Berger 2003) there is empirical evidence
for an increasing market share of electronic payment
. According to studies reported in (Berger 2003,
p.162) there is even empirical evidence for increased
productivity due to investment in IT labor, while
there is no empirical evidence for IT investments increasing
efficiency in general. This is consistent with
the basic insight that not the mere use of IT but the
kind and quality of this use can increase productivity
. Our paper shall help making 3G-WIS more popular
and thus contributes to internet banking more
completely covering the business at a higher level of
quality.

Related Work
A lot of related work has been done on the development
of web information systems.
The work in
(Atzeni et al. 1998) emphasizes the design of content
leading to databases, navigation leading to hypertext
, and presentation leading to the pages layout.
Other authors (see for example (Baresi et al. 2000),
(Bonifati et al. 2000), (G¨
adtke and Turowski 1999)
and (Rossi et al. 1999)) follow the same lines of
thought or concentrate on the "add-on" to database
design, emphasizing mainly the hypertext design
dealing with navigation structures (see (Garzotto et
al. 1993) and (Schwabe and Rossi 1998)). The work in
(Feyer et al. 1998) presents the forerunner of the theory
of media types (see (Schewe and Thalheim 2001)).
Media types provide a theoretically sound way to integrate
databases, external views, navigation structures
, operations, and even support adaptivity to different
users, environments and channels. The adaptivity
feature distinguishes them from the dialogue
types that are used to integrate database systems with
their user interfaces (see (Schewe and Schewe 2000)).
The work in (Schewe and Thalheim 2001) already
emphasizes that conceptual abstraction from content,
functionality, and presentation of an intended site
is not sufficient for the adequate conceptual modelling
of web-based systems, even if complex media
types are taken into consideration. Some of the approaches
mentioned before (see (Atzeni et al. 1998),
(Baresi et al. 2000), (Bonifati et al. 2000), (G¨
adtke
and Turowski 1999), (Rossi et al. 1999), (Garzotto
et al. 1993) and (Schwabe and Rossi 1998)) miss out
on the important aspect of story boarding, which is
needed to capture the business content of the system.
Story boarding in a process-oriented holistic manner
focusses on user intentions. In more recent work
some of the authors (Kaschek et al. 2003a) started
to investigate this idea more thoroughly.
Conceptual
modelling traditionally considered more ontolog-ical
aspects than epistemological ones. Since web information
systems in two respects considerably differ
from non-web information systems epistemological
aspects, however, need to be taken more seriously:
Web information systems are open in the sense that
actual users virtually may be just anyone. In non-web
system there was traditionally a much stricter
access control preventing non-staff from using the system
. The business idea, however, has changed and
customers need to be attracted and pre-selected by
a web information system. Furthermore, web information
systems are open in the sense that it is very
easy to use them for accessing other web systems.
This introduces more competition among those who
offer services on the web. Quality of web information
systems in the sense of fitness for users' use thus
tends to be more important than it was for non-web
systems. Web information systems partly substitute
staff-customer interaction by customer-computer interaction
.
Consequently, web information systems
must focus on aiding customers in doing the business
the system provider is engaged in. Clearly this
only can be done on the basis of a customer model.
User profiling together with story boarding is a holistic
manner for this.
In (Schewe and Thalheim 2001) it is suggested
that story boarding be supported through directed
graphs called scenarios, in which the nodes represent
the scenes and the edges correspond either to navigation
or to actions issued by the user. This extends
the work in (Feyer et al. 1998), where simply partially
ordered sets have been used. In addition, user profiling
is approached by using user dimensions capturing
various aspects of how to characterise users. This has
been extended in (Srinivasa 2001) to a formal description
of interactive systems.
The work in (D¨
usterh¨
oft and Thalheim 2001)
presents a formalised language SiteLang to support
the specification of story boards. the work also indicates
ideas how to exploit word fields for designing
dialogue steps in story boards. In (Schewe et al. 1995)
and (Schewe 1996) refinement primitives for dialogues
have been discussed. Due to the connection between
dialogues and scenarios, this approach to refinement
is also useful for story boarding. The work in (Schewe
et al. 2002) applies story boarding and user profiling
to the area of on-line loan systems.

Outline
In section 2 we discuss WIS specification, in particular
story spaces and scenarios, we further discuss media
objects, dialogue-step specification and context. In
the following section 3 we discuss database design for
WIS, utilization of context for WIS and a stepwise
WIS generation approach called "onion generation".
Finally, in section 4 we continue the discussion of our
example and show how our approach can be applied to
modelling of WIS. Due to space restrictions, however,
we can only discuss the storyboarding part.
WIS Specification
2.1
Story Spaces and Scenario
Modelling usage processes right from the beginning of
systems development requires using a sufficiently expressive
high level semantic model as a respective conceptual
framework. Storyboarding uses the metaphor
"story" to conceptualize usage processes.
We presuppose
that a story (for the source of the interrogatives
used here refer to (Zachman 1987, Sowa and
Zachman 1992)) tells what happened, why and where,
as well as who did it how and when. The story of
customer-WIS interaction thus is the intrigue or plot
of a narrative work or an account of events.
Within a story one can distinguish threads of activity
, so-called scenarios, i.e., paths of scenes that
are connected by transitions. See figure 2.1 for an example
scenario. We do not intend to model branching
stories. These require managing a number of activities
at the same time, i.e., in parallel. A capability
that -as we believe- many casual customers won't
have. With the term story space we mean the integration
of all scenarios in a story.
We define the story space
W
of a WIS W as
the 7-tuple (S
W
, T
W
, E
W
, G
W
, A
W
,
W
,
W
) where
S
W
, T
W
, E
W
, G
W
and A
W
are the set of scenes created
by W , the set of scene transitions and events that
can occur, the set of guards and the set of actions that
are relevant for W , respectively. Thus, T
W
is a subset
of S
W
× S
W
. Furthermore
W
: S
W
SceneSpec is
a function associating a scene specification with each
scene in S
W
, and
W
: T
W
E
W
× G
W
× A
W
,
t  (e, g, a) is a function associating with each scene
transition t occurring in W the event e that triggers
transition t, the guard g, i.e. a logical condition blocking
the transition if it evaluates to false on occurrence
of e, and the action a that is performed while the
transition takes place. The language SiteLang, see
(Thalheim and D¨
usterh¨
oft 2001), offers concepts and
notation for specification of story spaces, scene and
scenarios in them. Scenes and their specifications are
discussed in subsection 2.2.
2.2
Scenes
We consider scenes as the conceptual locations at
which the customer-WIS interaction, i.e., dialogue

takes place.
Dialogues can be specified using so-called
dialogue-step expressions. Scenes can be distinguished
from each other by means of their identifier
: Scene-ID. With each scene there is associated a
media object and the set of actors that are involved
in it. Furthermore, with each scene a representation
specification is associated as well as a context. Scenes
therefore can be specified using the following frame:
Scene = ( Scene-ID

Roles
Representation (styles, defaults, emphasis, ...)
Context (equipment, channel, particular)
Dialogue-step expressions consist of dialogues and
operators applied to them. Dialogue steps are discussed
in subsection 2.4 below. The provided operators
are based on the basic dialogue step algebra introduced
in (Thalheim and D¨
usterh¨
oft 2001):
· Basic control commands are sequence ; (execution
of steps in sequence), parallel split
|

| (execute
steps in parallel), exclusive choice
|

| (choose one
execution path from many alternatives), synchronization
|
sync
| (synchronize two parallel threads of
execution by an synchronization condition
sync
,
and simple merge + (merge two alternative execution
paths). The exclusive choice is considered
to be the default parallel operation and is denoted
by
||.
· Structural control commands are arbitrary cycles

(execute steps w/out any structural restriction
on loops), arbitrary cycles
+
(execute steps
w/out any structural restriction on loops but at
least once), optional execution [ ] (execute the
step zero times or once), implicit termination

(terminate if there is nothing to be done), entry
step in the scene
and termination step in the
scene
.
· Advanced branching and synchronization control
commands are multiple choice
|
(
m,n)
| (choose between
m and n execution paths from several alternatives
), multiple merge (merge many execution
paths without synchronizing), discriminator
(merge many execution paths without synchronizing
, execute the subsequent steps only
once) n-out-of-m join (merge many execution
paths, perform partial synchronization and execute
subsequent step only once), and synchronizing
join (merge many execution paths, synchronize
if many paths are taken, simple merge
if only one execution path is taken).
· We also may define control commands on multiple
objects (CMO) such as CMO with a priori
known design time knowledge (generate many instances
of one step when a number of instances
is known at the design time), CMO with a priori
known runtime knowledge (generate many instances
of one step when a number of instances
can be determined at some point during the runtime
(as in FOR loops)), CMO with no a priori
runtime knowledge (generate many instances of
one step when a number of instances cannot be
determined (as in a while loop)), and CMO requiring
synchronization (synchronization edges)
(generate many instances of one activity and synchronize
afterwards).
· State-based control commands are deferred choice
(execute one of the two alternative threads, the
choice which tread is to be executed should be
implicit), interleaved parallel executing (execute
two activities in random order, but not in parallel
), and milestone (enable an activity until a
milestone has been reached).
· Finally, cancellation control commands are used,
e.g. cancel step (cancel (disable) an enabled step)
and cancel case (cancel (disable) the step).
These control composition operators are generalizations
of workflow patterns ( see, e.g. (Workflow Management
Coalition 1999, Jablonski 1996)) and follow
approaches developed for Petri net algebras.
A graphical representation of a login scene is given
in figure 2.2. We are interested in well-formed dialogues
and do not allow specifications which lead to
and-split or or-split common in workflow specifications
. This scene is specified by the dialogue step
expression

Figure 2.3: Cutout of the profiling schema
The core of a media type is defined by a view on
some underlying database schema, i.e. it consists of
a view schema and a defining query. However, this
query must be able to create identifiers in order to create
links between the various media objects. This core
of a media type -- called raw media type in (Schewe
and Thalheim 2001) -- is extended in three directions
:
· As a first extension operations are added to the
view in the same way as d-operations were added
to dialogue objects in (Schewe and Schewe 2000).
Basically, the use of operations just adds dynamics
to the media objects. So, if a media object
is associated with a scene, the operations of the
media object define the available dynamic functionality
.
· The second extension provides adaptivity and
hierarchies. Adaptivity to the user deals with
needs arising from different users.
Adaptivity
to the technical environment copes with technical
restrictions of end-devices. Adaptivity to
the communication channel deals with adaptation
to needs arising from various communication
channels. For all three forms of adaptivity media
types provide mechanisms for a controlled form
of information loss, which is coupled with algorithms
for the splitting of information content.
The hierarchies are adopted from dimension hierarchies
in OLAP.
· The third extension simply covers ordering and
other presentation options.
Thus, roughly speaking media objects consist of
abstract containers, supported DBMS processes and
database manipulations requests.
Basic media objects
(Schewe and Thalheim 2000) are characterized
by syntactic expressions, have a semantical meaning
and are used within a certain pragmatical framework.
Media objects can be parameterized. Typical parameters
are the representation style, the actor frame, and
the context frame. Therefore we distinguish between
media objects and runtime media objects in which all
parameters are instantiated.
During runtime, the media object is extended by
specific escort information (Thalheim 2000). This escort
information is represented for user support. It
allows the user to see the history of steps performed
before being in the current state. Escort information
is further generated from the story space. In this case
a user is informed on alternative paths which could
be used to reach the given scene and which might be
used for backtracking from the current scene.
For the generation of media objects and their
composition on the basis of information units we
extend the classical SQL frame to the frame
generate Mapping : Vars
Structure
from Views
where Selection condition
represent using Style guide
& Abstraction
browsing definition Condition
& Navigation
The views and therefore the media object may have
hidden parameters (for instance, EventID) which are
not visible to the actor. They can be parameterized
by variables (for instance, @Today). For media objects
we reuse ideas developed for OLAP technology
(Thalheim 2000):
· views on ER schemata (abstraction on schemata
(aggregation, scoping, ...), versions),
· variations of generation functions,
· display with canonical functionality (drill-down,
roll-up, rotate, pivoting, push, pull, dimension,
aggregation),
· using generic evaluation functions and models,
· implicit incorporation of hierarchies and
· implicit incorporation of time, space, ....
Furthermore, involved actors are specified in dependence
on their profiles, tasks assigned to them,
their access and manipulation rights, and their roles
to be taken while visiting the scene. This specification
is based on (Altus 2000) and similar to profiles
of actors in information systems.
It is our aim to specify generic scenes. Thus, we
add the representation styles which can be applied to
the media object of the scene. Representation depends
on the equipment of the actor.
In the city
site projects, we have gained experience with different
representation styles: internet display with high-speed
channel, internet-display with medium speed
display (default style), videotext and WAP display.
For instance, for videotext any graphical information
is cut out or replaced by textual information.
Finally, the context of access is specified. Access
determines the display facilities. Channels can be of
high or low speed. The particular usage of a scene by
an actor depends on the scenario history.
The login scene in Figure 2.2 is based on the
schema in Figure 2.3.
The corresponding media object specification has
the following structure:
MediaObject(
@Customer ID) =
generate (ID, profile, portfolio, context)
from Customer
1 Login Account History
1 Customer Profile
1 Customer Portfolio 1 ...
where Customer.ID = @Customer ID ...
represent using
41
XSL style.Ident =
Profile Type.Preference.StyleIdent
&
createVarsFor(profile, portfolio, context)
browsing definition Customer
portfolio
...
&

none
The representation styles determine the order and
the tailoring of the elements of the media object.
2.4
Dialogue Steps
We conceptualize the customer-WIS interaction as a
dialogue between these two. Therefore the customer-WIS
interaction unfolds in a sequences of dialogue
steps, i.e., elementary communication acts.
The
basic WIS-state transformations triggered by actors
can thus be understood as caused by dialogue steps.
These may access the media object that is associated
to the scene within which the dialogue step occurs.
Comparable to (Goldin et al. 2000) we use the following
frame for specifying the control of dialogue steps:
on precond if event and guard
do action result in postcond
Consequently dialogue steps may be specified by
the following frame:
DialogueStep(
Identification ) =
( sub-unit = view on media object of the scene
enabled processes =
subset of supplied processes,
manipulation requests
actor =
subset of enabled actors in a given context
control =
( precondition, enabling event,
guard, postcondition) )
Dialogue step specifications can be represented
graphically as shown in figure 2.4. The figure for the
scene 'anonymous login' represents the specification
of dialogue step 'login'.

Figure 2.4: Dialogue Step for Anonymous Login
Based on the properties of the actions we conclude,
for instance, that after withdrawal a previous member
of a cooperating group cannot participate in the discussions
in the community. A task property frame is
defined by a task name, reasons for task involvement,
an aim, a postcondition (enabled next activities), the
information from the database, the information for
the database, the resources (actor, resources, partner
), and a starting situation (precondition, activity,
priority, frequency, repetition rate).
We use graphical representations of scene specifications
as indicated by figure 2.5. Scenes are represented
by frameboxes and dialogue steps by ellipses.
The transitions among dialogue steps are represented
by arrows between these. We use the graphical notation
developed for state charts, e.g., the default start
step of a scene is denoted by a solid circle, the end
state by a solid circle surrounded by an empty circle,
the history entry into a scene is denoted by an `H'
surrounded by an empty circle. Furthermore, we can

Context
Context has been usually defined within the object
sets of the database (Bell 2001, Connolly 2001).
There only very few trials to consider context of the
scenarios or stories (Whitsey 2003).
In (Thalheim
2000a) context has been defined for media types. For
dealing more complete and justifiable with context we
start with a dictionary definition of context of something
as that what one needs to understand the something
. This implies our understanding of context as
a three place predicate C(S, H, A) which if true says
that actor A needs helper H to act reasonably on
S. If the actor is an individual then we stay with
the focus on understanding. For non-human actors,
however, we focus on acting according to predefined
quality aspects and behavior rules. The something we
consider here as relevant are WIS-parts. The helpers
we here take into account are the various data that
are relevant for the WIS-parts in question. The actors
we consider here are the WIS and the individuals
occupying the roles: customer, vendor and developer
with respect to the WIS at hand. We thus distinguish
the following contexts:
Customer's scenario context , i.e., that what the customer
needs to understand for efficiently and ef-fectively
solve his/her business problem.
Vendor's WIS-context , i.e., that what the vendor
needs to understand how to run the WIS economically
. Data that typically is part of this context
are:
· the intention of the provider,
· the theme of the web site,
· the mission or corporate identity of the site,
and
· the occasion and purpose of the visits of actors
.
Developer's WIS-context , i.e., that what the developer
needs to understand for being capable of implementing
the WIS. Data that typically is part
of this context are:
· the potential environment, e.g. hard- and
software, channels,
· the information system, especially the associated
databases,

· the tasks to be performed within the story,

WIS's scene context , i.e., that what the WIS needs
to be capable of making solving certain business
problems easy and pleasant for customers. Data
that typically is part of this context are:
· History and current usage allow context
adaptation to scenarios which are played at
present by the current user.
· Adaptation to the current environment is defined
as context adaptation to the current
channel, to the client infrastructure and to
the server load.
· Users are grouped to actors. Therefore, we
can define the current user by instantiation
of the actor.
· Goals and particular, policy (exceptions, social
, organizational) define a specialization
of the content, structuring and functionality
of a web page.
A WIS is supported by media objects that belong
to media types.
The collection of all media types
is called suite. Our framework offers four hooks for
dealing with the context we need to consider:
1. Specialization of media type suite for
usage
and
user adaptation:
The database types may have subtypes specializing
the database types. Media types are defined
on the basis of views. Therefore, we can follow
the approach discussed in (Thalheim 2000a) for
specialization of types. Specialization is defin-able
through specialization of types, instantiation
of parameters. extension of types, and restriction
and constraint application.
2. Application of rules towards
generation
of
extended
suites:
Suites can be extended by providing view rules
defining views on top of the media types. This
approach supports portfolio extension and container
extension.
3. Instantiation of explicit context parameters can be
used for adaptation of web sites to the current
profile, to the current environment or to the current
workload.
4. Storage of utilization profile similar to login track
supports to use history of previous utilization of
the web site by the user. We extend the web site
database by explicit utilization logs for used media
objects, preferences of usage, users workspace
or work rooms, and variations of users media objects
Developing the Database Used to Generate the Web Site
3.1
Database Modelling for WIS
Web site management becomes a nightmare whenever
a web site has been developed in a handicraft
approach. For this reason, generation of web
sites is currently based on web site content management
. Content management systems currently support
the representation of web pages on a take-and-place
metaphor: Select or compile the content objects
of a page, compile the navigation structure and place
the content objects using page frames. Our web site
team also used this approach. This approach is entirely
satisfying the needs as long as the general structure
of a web site is stable and no adaptation to the
user is required.
In order to dynamically generate the web site we
decided to store the web site stories in a database.
The structure of this database is displayed in figure
3.1.
We specify the web site story space based on the
our web SiteLang. This specification is inserted into
the database by the SiteLang editor. We can now extract
the page under consideration by an instantiated
query from this database. Context may be infused
directly depending on the query result.
Similar to the context infusion, users of a web site
have their own profile, their own portfolio and their
history. This information is used for adapting the
content of the web site to the current usage.
3.2
Context Infusion in Scenarios
Typical business processes have a very large number
of variants.
Classically, workflow approaches have
43
been used for specification of such varieties. Since
the complexity of variants might be much higher the
workflow approach did not succeed in providing a
sound basis for the specification of all variants. We
observe, however, that in practice these varieties are
internally structured. They may be composed, extended
or filtered by smaller scenarios.
e-banking
challenges storyboarding by its orthogonality and variety
.
Instead of specifying all possible variants we prefer
to model the generation mechanism of the very
large variety of scenarios. This generation supports
runtime adaptation to the current scenario, the context
and other parameters. At the same time, banking
sites are threatened to expose customers to the
"lost in hyperspace syndrome". Therefore, customers
should be supported in tracking back onto the right
path.
Our solution to this challenge is based on generic
parameters that are instantiated depending on the
customer, the history, the context etc. Each set of
media objects is specified by a context-free expression
with a set of parameters. These parameters are
instantiated depending on
· the customer profile,
· the customer task portfolio,
· the customer computational environment,
· the presentation environment, and
· the available and accessible media objects.
Instead of providing a full generation rule set we illustrate
our approach on the basis of an example. A
customer of a bank provides his/her identity e
1
, inserts
some data e
2
,1
and e
2
,2
in any order or signs that
the bank may request these data from somewhere else
e
2
,3
. Then the customer seeks a loan and fills the corresponding
forms e
3
. The customer gives bail data in
different variants (e
5
,1
|| (e
5
,2
; e
5
,3
)). The scenario is
supported by the eight media objects. Now we can
inject the context into the media object expression of
the scenario. For instance, we may have the following
stepwise refinements:
· Media objects of a scenario:
e

The Onion Generation
XML documents provide a universal structuring
mechanism. XSL rules allow to generate XML documents
from XML suites. This opportunity supports
a multi-layer generation of web information systems.
Thus we use the multi-layer onion generation presented
in Figure 3.2.

Figure 3.2: The Onion Approach to Stepwise WIS-Generation
The onion generation approach is based on the layered
structure of the WIS arising from the use of SiteLang
and media objects. On the outermost shell the
presentation facilities are introduced. This shell deals
with style presentation functions. Containers used in
the next inner shell are used to ship information from
the web-server to the user. Thus, this shell deals with
the adaptation to the user and his/her environment.
The next inner shell handles the information units,
i.e. the core media objects. Inside this shell we find
further shells dealing with views on the underlying
database, and innermost we find the database itself.
The onion approach fits nicely into a translational
approach, which generates consistent sets of XML
documents. In our projects we used the XML extender
of the database system DB2 to generate XML
documents. Thus, the layering approach to the generation
of XML displayed in Figure 3.2 allows to use
another strategy to generate XML documents. This
facility is displayed in Figure 3.3.
This transformation approach has been success-fully
used in two of our e-learning projects and our
community services projects. These project require
sophisticated context adaptation. The approach implements
an XML suite on top of the relational DBMS
DB2. The extended ER model (Thalheim 2000) provides
a better approach to XML suite generation than
relational models or the classical ER model for a number
of reasons:
· Structures can be defined already in complex
nested formats.
· Types of higher order are supported.
· The model uses cardinality constraints with participation
semantics.

Figure 3.3: The General Procedure for Translation from SiteLang to XML
An Advanced e-Banking Application
4.1
Banking and Mortgages
According to (Wierichs and Smets 2001) a bank is an
". . . institution that as part of an economy offers financial
services. The economical function of banks is
to create a liquidity equalization in the cash flow that
is reverse to the product and service flow. The focal
points of the bank operational activity are conducting
payments, acceptance of money for investment, and
granting credits." Furthermore the particular liquidity
equalization that is chosen out of the set of possible
such equalizations is a preferable one. The respective
preference structure is worked out by banks
on base of an assessment involving financing cost and
interests, see (Matthews et al. 2003).
A loan according to (Wierichs and Smets 2001) is
the "relinquishment of money or other fungible (...)
properties connected with the obligation of the debtor
to give back the relinquished in equal kind, quality
and quantity." An enhanced version of the model of
the loan process is represented in figure 4.1 as a UML
sequence diagram. It shows the roles involved in the
loan process as the labels inside the rectangular boxes
on the top of the diagram. It further indicates the
concurrency that may be utilized in this process. It
achieves this by means of showing the communication
between the roles. This communication is represented
by the arrows starting at the dashed lines
that represent logical time, i.e., life lines of the roles.
The labels attached to the arrows indicate the content
of the message associated with the respective arrow.
The bottom level rectangle containing the messages
'Payback()' and 'CheckPayback()' signifies that these
messages are to be repeatedly sent until the stop condition
signified by the asterisk and displayed below
the rectangle 'debit position balanced' becomes true.
4.2
Mortgages and variants
The figure 4.1 from a bank technical point of view
schematizes the process. This process clearly is not
fully suited as the only base of application development
. For aiding development more information is
needed about how customers are anticipated to interact
with the system under construction. We use here
the function
W
of the story space
W
of a WIS W
to show how the customer interaction with the WIS
changes the appearance of it for the customer Story
boarding is a useful technique to obtain the required
information.
Our respective starting point is the investigation
of the Web site of the Australian and New Zealand
based ASB Bank. From earlier work, see (Kaschek
et al. 2003) we knew that it offered an online loan
application facility.
We investigated this Web site
more closely and found that this site at each of its
pages essentially offered customers data that can be
typed as follows:
· advertisement, i.e., information about ASB
Bank including a welcome and a logo.
· disclaimer, i.e., a statement limiting the legal
responsibility of ASB Bank with respect to the
data displayed and the implications customers
might draw from it.
· search, i.e., a facility taking an unlimited customer
input and returning those ASB Bank
pages that best met this search expression.
· highlights, i.e., the main contents that ASB
Bank wants to be displayed at each particular
of its Web pages.
· path, i.e., a redundancy eliminated sequence of
ASB Bank Web pages visited so far by the customer
interacting with the site and supposed to
be used as a navigation aid.
· reference, i.e., a couple of links the target of
which offer more information about the page actually
visited by the customer.
· business branch selector, i.e., a navigation
bar that breaks down the information space of
the site into subspaces according to the business
branches of ASB Bank.
· subspace selector, i.e., a navigation bar that
for each subspace that corresponds to a business
branch breaks down the subspace into 2nd. level
subspaces.
· subspace navigator, i.e., for each 2nd. level
subspace a navigation bar breaking down the
subspace in a number of information space locations
.

Figure 4.1: UML diagram representing the loan process
We have then represented the navigation structure
offered by the ASB Web site as a state chart the
states of which represent scenes. The state transitions
are presupposed to be triggered by customers clicking
links, i.e., navigation events. The labels attached
to the state transitions are a string representing the
navigation event and an action carried out throughout
the transition. This action is prefixed by a slash,
i.e., by "/". The semantics of the action is specified
in form of a programming language like assignment
and assigns new values to variables holding the data
listed above. In this way one can specify what data
and functionality is accessible to a customer at a particular
scene. Explanations and tables or the like are
presupposed to be just text. All other transition labels
used as values in assignments are presupposed
to be links. If a variable is supposed to hold several
links then these are connected by a plus sign, i.e., by
"+". If more than one action has to take place at a
transition then all these actions are connected by a
&-sign.
The variables used in figure 4.2 are D, S, H, A,
R and P respectively representing values of type disclaimer
, search facility, highlight, advertisement, references
and path. Those of them being displayed at
a particular page are represented as non delimited
string, i.e., if all of them occur the string DSHARP is
attached as label to the state representing the page.
Furthermore the variables BS, SS and SN are used to
respectively represent values of type business branch
selector, subspace selector and subspace navigator.
The initial state in the figure is reached after moving
onto the home page of ASB Bank and clicking
BS.Personal which signifies the business branch of retail
banking. The other 1st. level subspaces of the
application's information space are "All", "Business",
"Institutional" and "Rural" in the obvious meaning
. The subspace selector of "BS.Personal" allows
to chose from 18 different 2nd. level subspaces. One
of them is Home loans. Clicking it, i.e., "BS.Personal-SS
.Home loans" leads to the initial state of figure 4.2.
If required we could add further navigation detail
including the impact of navigation on the variables
occurring in the figure. Furthermore if it would be
required we could add further variables to represent
data of types here not dealt with.
4.3
Adaptation to customers, context and
specific case
Adaptation to customers is a must if optimal customer
support is aimed at. ASB Bank realizes a limited
customer adaptation in that it offers in the subspace
selector of BS.Personal second level subspaces
both for kids and for young folks. ASB Bank concerning
the home loan subspace of its information space
does not offer much adaptation to customers. It only
offers a bank technical terms dictionary and specif-ically
addresses first home buyers.
Neither are all
New Zealand official language versions of the Web
site available nor can it be tuned to meet any kind of
disabilities such as weak eyesight or color blindness.
The approach to adaptation to customers taken by
sites like the one under investigation consists in identifying
the subspace of the information space they
create that most likely will fit best the needs of a
particular customer. The match between customer
and subspace is then done such that the customer
is asked to give some characteristics of him or her
into the system and based on that the respective subspace
is chosen. ASB Bank does so concerning kids
and young folks. Other banks have additionally the
customer type student or wealthy individual. This
strategy is suggested by the fact that the site vendor
in general does not know much about the individuals
accessing its site. A technique to consider knowledge
about customers to the design process is the creation
and use of personas, i.e., archetypical customers and
design the navigation structure as well as the page
layout such that it fits optimally to the personas used.
Concerning more detail about personas in particular
their construction see, e.g. (Wodtke 2003, pp. 159)
Adaptation of the business case at hand of course
can only be achieved in response to the customer-site
interaction. In the navigation structure diagram
in figure 4.2 we have used variable of data types that
were chosen with respect to the site at hand, i.e., ASB
Bank's Web site. We expect that this adaptation can
always be achieved the way we have proposed here.
Once the analysis has shown what data and functionality
shall be accessible to customers data and functionality
can be typed and variables of the respective
type can be used to describe how the site adapts to
the actual use. A type level adaptation that can be
carried out while customers are interacting with a site
is semi automatic reconsideration of the type of customer
: Customers in this respect are presupposed to
be characterized by a value for each of a number of

dimensions. The customer type according to (Schewe
and Thalheim 2001) can be defined as a convex region
in the multi dimensional space create as cartesian
product of the scales associated to the customer
dimensions. Based on an automatic customer assessment
that in response to his or her site-interaction
updates the scores in each of the dimension throughout
customer-site interaction one can then track how
a customer's trace moves through this space and detect
when a modified type would better fit the customer's
behavior than the actual type does. Clearly
such update should only be done with customer permission
Conclusion
Banking services such as online home-loan application
require a very sophisticated and well-adapted internet
interface. Customers want to focus on solving
their business problem, i.e., the goal they want to
achieve by means of interacting with the WIS. They
consider WIS as tools that shall be easy to handle,
completely cover the business and do not add technical
complexities to it. Customers want to have a
pleasant usage experience, in particular they do not
want to be treated like everybody else. They want
WIS remember and exploit their usage peculiarities
in authenticated and where adequate in anonymous
sessions. This paper shows how this can be achieved.
As a guiding principle we introduce considering context
and using it to simplify WIS-handling. We have
shown how WIS's scene context can be injected into
the WIS and how XML suites can be generated using
the story board of the site and available customer
data.
