Language-specific Models in Multilingual Topic Tracking
ABSTRACT
Topic tracking is complicated when the stories in the stream occur 
in multiple languages. Typically, researchers have trained only 
English topic models because the training stories have been provided
in English. In tracking, non-English test stories are then 
machine translated into English to compare them with the topic 
models. We propose a native language hypothesis stating that 
comparisons would be more effective in the original language of 
the story. We first test and support the hypothesis for story link 
detection. For topic tracking the hypothesis implies that it should 
be preferable to build separate language-specific topic models for 
each language in the stream. We compare different methods of 
incrementally building such native language topic models.

INTRODUCTION
Topic detection and tracking (TDT) is a research area concerned 
with organizing a multilingual stream of news broadcasts as it arrives
over time. TDT investigations sponsored by the U.S. government
include five different tasks: story link detection, clustering
(topic detection), topic tracking, new event (first story) detection
, and story segmentation. The present research focuses on 
topic tracking, which is similar to filtering in information retrieval
. Topics are defined by a small number of (training) stories, 
typically one to four, and the task is to find all the stories on those 
topics in the incoming stream.
TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 
1999. TDT2 contained stories in English and Mandarin. TDT3 
and TDT4 included English, Mandarin, and Arabic. Machine-translations
into English for all non-English stories were provided
, allowing participants to ignore issues of story translation.
All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models. 
In story link detection, the simplest case, the comparison is between
pairs of stories, to decide whether given pairs of stories are 
on the same topic or not. In topic tracking, the comparison is between
a story and a topic, which is often represented as a centroid 
of story vectors, or as a language model covering several stories.
Our focus in this research was to explore the best ways to compare
stories and topics when stories are in multiple languages. We 
began with the hypothesis that if two stories originated in the 
same language, it would be best to compare them in that language, 
rather than translating them both into another language for comparison
. This simple assertion, which we call the native language 
hypothesis, is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.
The picture gets more complex in a task like topic tracking, which 
begins with a small number of training stories (in English) to define
each topic. New stories from a stream must be placed into 
these topics. The streamed stories originate in different languages, 
but are also available in English translation. The translations have 
been performed automatically by machine translation algorithms, 
and are inferior to manual translations. At the beginning of the 
stream, native language comparisons cannot be performed because
there are no native language topic models (other than English
). However, later in the stream, once non-English documents 
have been seen, one can base subsequent tracking on native-language
comparisons, by adaptively training models for additional 
languages. There are many ways this adaptation could be performed
, and we suspect that it is crucial for the first few non-English
stories to be placed into topics correctly, to avoid building 
non-English models from off-topic stories.
Previous research in multilingual TDT has not attempted to compare
the building of multiple language-specific models with single
-language topic models, or to obtain native-language models 
through adaptation. The focus of most multilingual work in TDT 
for example

[2]

[12]

[13], has been to compare the efficacy of machine
translation of test stories into a base language, with other 
means of translation. Although these researchers normalize scores 
for the source language, all story comparisons are done within the 
base language. This is also true in multilingual filtering, which is 
a similar task

[14].
The present research is an exploration of the native language hypothesis
for multilingual topic tracking. We first present results on 
story link detection, to support the native language hypothesis in a 
simple, understandable task. Then we present experiments that 
test the hypothesis in the topic tracking task. Finally we consider 
several different ways to adapt topic models to allow native language
comparisons downstream.

Although these experiments were carried out in service of TDT, 
the results should equally apply to other domains which require 
the comparison of documents in different languages, particularly 
filtering, text classification and clustering.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Experiments are replicated with two different data sets, TDT3 and 
TDT4, and two very different similarity functions - cosine similarity
, and another based on relevance modeling, described in the 
following two sections. Cosine similarity can be seen as a basic 
default approach, which performs adequately, and relevance modeling
is a state of the art approach which yields top-rated performance
. Confirming the native-language hypothesis in both systems 
would show its generality.
In the rest of this section, we describe the TDT data sets, then we 
describe how story link detection and topic tracking are carried 
out in cosine similarity and relevance modeling systems. Next, we 
describe the multilingual aspects of the systems.
2.1

TDT3 Data
TDT data consist of a stream of news in multiple languages and 
from different media - audio from television, radio, and web news 
broadcasts, and text from newswires. Two forms of transcription 
are available for the audio stream. The first form comes from 
automatic speech recognition and includes transcription errors 
made by such systems. The second form is a manual transcription, 
which has few if any errors. The audio stream can also be divided 
into stories automatically or manually (so-called reference 
boundaries). For all the research reported here, we used manual 
transcriptions and reference boundaries.
The characteristics of the TDT3 data sets for story link detection 
and topic tracking are summarized in Tables 1-3.

Story Representation and Similarity
2.2.1

Cosine similarity
To compare two stories for link detection, or a story with a topic 
model for tracking, each story is represented as a vector of terms 
with tf·idf term weights:

where tf is the number of occurrences of the term in the story, N is 
the total number of documents in the collection, and df is the 
number of documents containing the term. Collection statistics N 
and  df are computed incrementally, based on the documents already
in the stream within a deferral period after the test story 
arrives. The deferral period was 10 for link detection and 1 for 
topic tracking. For link detection, story vectors were pruned to the 
1000 terms with the highest term weights.

If the similarity of two stories exceeds a yes/no threshold, the 
stories are considered to be about the same topic.
For topic tracking, a topic model is a centroid, an average of the 
vectors for the N
t
training stories. Topic models are pruned to 100
terms based on the term weights. Story vectors pruned to 100 
terms are compared to centroids using equation (2). If the similarity
exceeds a yes/no threshold, the story is considered on-topic.
2.2.2

Relevance modeling
Relevance modeling is a statistical technique for estimating language
models from extremely small samples, such as queries,

[9].
If  Q is small sample of text, and C is a large collection of documents
, the language model for Q is estimated as:

|
(
)
|
(

M
P

P

(3)
A relevance model, then, is a mixture of language models M
d
of
every document d in the collection, where the document models 
are weighted by the posterior probability of producing the query 
P(M
d
|Q). The posterior probability is computed as:

(
(4)
Equation (4) assigns the highest weights to documents that are 
most likely to have generated Q, and can be interpreted as nearest-neighbor
smoothing, or a massive query expansion technique.
To apply relevance modeling to story link detection, we estimate 
the similarity between two stories A and B by pruning the stories 
to short queries, estimating relevance models for the queries, and 
measuring the similarity between the two relevance models. Each 
story is replaced by a query consisting of the ten words in the 
query with the lowest probability of occurring by chance in ran-domly
drawing |A| words from the collection C:

where |A| is the length of the story A,  A
w
is the number of times
word w occurs in A, |C| is the size of the collection, and C
w
is the
number of times word w occurs in C.
Story relevance models are estimated using equation (4). Similarity
between relevance models is measured using the symmetrized 
clarity-adjusted divergence

where  P(w|Q

P(w|GE) is the background (General English, Arabic, or Mandarin
) probability of w, computed from the entire collection of stories
in the language within the same deferral period used for cosine
similarity.
To apply relevance modeling to topic tracking, the asymmetric

where  P(w|T) is a relevance model of the topic T. Because of

rather than relevance models are used for the story model

can be found in

[2].
2.3

Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks. For each test trial, the 
system attempts to make a yes/no decision. In story link detection, 
the decision is whether the two members of a story pair belong to 
the same topic. In topic tracking, the decision is whether a story in 
the stream belongs to a particular topic. In all tasks, performance 
is summarized in two ways: a detection cost function (C
Det
) and a
decision error tradeoff (DET) curve. Both are based on the rates 
of two kinds of errors a detection system can make: misses, in 
which the system gives a no answer where the correct answer is 
yes, and false alarms, in which the system gives a yes answer 
where the correct answer is no.
The DET curve plots the miss rate (P
Miss
) as a function of false
alarm rate (P
Fa
), as the yes/no decision threshold is swept through
its range. P
Miss
and P
Fa
are computed for each topic, and then
averaged across topics to yield topic-weighted curves. An example 
can be seen in Figure 1 below. Better performance is indicated by 
curves more to the lower left of the graph.
The detection cost function is computed for a particular threshold 
as follows:

C
Det
= (C
Miss
* P
Miss
* P
Target
+ C
Fa
* P
Fa
* (1-P
Target
))
(9)
where:   P
Miss
= #Misses / #Targets
P
Fa
= #False Alarms / #NonTargets
C
Miss
and C
Fa
are the costs of a missed detection and false alarm,
respectively, and are specified for the application, usually at 10 
and 1, penalizing misses more than false alarms. P
Target
is the a
priori probability of finding a target, an item where the answer 
should be yes, set by convention to 0.02.
The cost function is normalized:
(C
Det
)
Norm
= C
Det
/ MIN(C
Miss
* C
Target
, C
Fa
* (1-P
Target
)) (10)
and averaged over topics. Each point along the detection error 
tradeoff curve has a value of (C
Det
)
Norm
. The minimum value found
on the curve is known as the min(C
Det
)
Norm
. It can be interpreted as
the value of C
Det
)
Norm
at the best possible threshold. This measure
allows us to separate performance on the task from the choice of 
yes/no threshold. Lower cost scores indicate better performance. 
More information about these measures can be found in

[5].

Language-specific Comparisons
English stories were lower-cased and stemmed using the kstem 
stemmer

[6]. Stop words were removed. For native Arabic
comparisons, stories were converted from Unicode UTF-8 to windows
(CP1256) encoding, then normalized and stemmed with a 
light stemmer

[7]. Stop words were removed. For native Mandarin
comparisons, overlapping character bigrams were compared.
STORY LINK DETECTION
In this section we present experimental results for story link detection
, comparing a native condition with an English baseline. In 
the English baseline, all comparisons are in English, using machine
translation (MT) for Arabic and Mandarin stories. Corpus 
statistics are computed incrementally for all the English and 
translated-into-English stories. In the Native condition, two stories
originating in the same language are compared in that language
. Corpus statistics are computed incrementally for the stories 
in the language of the comparison. Cross language pairs in the 
native condition are compared in English using MT, as in the 
baseline.

Figure 1 shows the DET curves for the TDT3 story link detection 
task, and Table 4 shows the minimum cost. The figure and table 
show that native language comparisons (dotted) consistently outperform
comparisons based on machine-translated English (solid). 
This difference holds both for the basic cosine similarity system 
(first row) (black curves), and for the relevance modeling system 
(second row) (gray curves). These results support the general 
conclusion that when two stories originate in the same language, it 
is better to carry out similarity comparisons in that language, 
rather than translating them into a different language.
TOPIC TRACKING
In tracking, the system decides whether stories in a stream belong 
to predefined topics. Similarity is measured between a topic 
model and a story, rather than between two stories. The native 
language hypothesis for tracking predicts better performance if 
incoming stories are compared in their original language with 
topic models in that language, and worse performance if translated 
stories are compared with English topic models.
The hypothesis can only be tested indirectly, because Arabic and 
Mandarin training stories were not available for all tracking topics
. In this first set of experiments, we chose to obtain native language
training stories from the stream of test stories using topic 
adaptation, that is, gradual modification of topic models to incorporate
test stories that fit the topic particularly well.
Adaptation begins with the topic tracking scenario described 
above in section

2.2, using a single model per topic based on a
small set of training stories in English. Each time a story is compared
to a topic model to determine whether it should be classed 
as on-topic, it is also compared to a fixed adaptation threshold
ad
= 0.5 (not to be confused with the yes/no threshold mentioned
in section

2.2.1). If the similarity score is greater than
ad
, the
story is added to the topic set, and the topic model recomputed. 
For clarity, we use the phrase topic set to refer to the set of stories 
from which the topic model is built, which grows under adaptation
. The training set includes only the original N
t
training stories
for each topic. For cosine similarity, adaptation consists of 
computing a new centroid for the topic set and pruning to 100 
terms. For relevance modeling, a new topic model is computed 
according to Equation (8). At most 100 stories are placed in each 
topic set.
We have just described global adaptation, in which stories are 
added to global topic models in English. Stories that originated in 
Arabic or Mandarin are compared and added in their machine-translated
version.
Native adaptation differs from global adaptation in making separate
topic models for each source language. To decide whether a 
test story should be added to a native topic set, the test story is 
compared in its native language with the native model, and added 
to the native topic set for that language if its similarity score exceeds
ad
. The English version of the story is also compared to the
global topic model, and if its similarity score exceeds
ad
, it is
added to the global topic set.  (Global models continue to adapt
for other languages which may not yet have a native model, or for 
smoothing, discussed later.)
At the start there are global topic models and native English topic 
models based on the training stories, but no native Arabic or 
Mandarin topic models. When there is not yet a native topic 
model in the story's original language, the translated story is 
compared to the global topic model. If the similarity exceeds
ad
,
the native topic model is initialized with the untranslated story.
Yes/no decisions for topic tracking can then be based on the untranslated
story's similarity to the native topic model if one exists. 
If there is no native topic model yet for that language and topic, 
the translated story is compared to the global topic model.
We have described three experimental conditions: global adapted, 
native adapted, and a baseline. The baseline, described in Section

2.2, can also be called global unadapted. The baseline uses a 
single English model per topic based on the small set of training 
stories. A fourth possible condition, native unadapted is problematic
and not included here. There is no straightforward way to 
initialize native language topic models without adaptation when 
training stories are provided only in English.

The TDT3 tracking results on three conditions, replicated with the

modeling) and two different training set sizes (N

seen in Table 5. DET curves for N
t

cosine similarity (above) and relevance modeling (RM) (below).
Table 5 shows a robust adaptation effect for cosine and relevance 
model experiments, and for 2 or 4 training stories. Native and 
global adaptation are always better (lower cost) than baseline 
unadapted tracking. In addition, relevance modeling produces 
better results than cosine similarity. However, results do not show 
the predicted advantage for native adapted topic models over 
global adapted topic models. Only cosine similarity, N
t
=4, seems
to show the expected difference (shaded cells), but the difference 
is very small. The DET curve in Figure 2 shows no sign of a native
language effect.
Table 6 shows minimum cost figures computed separately for 
English, Mandarin, and Arabic test sets.  Only English shows a 
pattern similar to the composite results of Table 5 (see the shaded 
cells). For cosine similarity, there is not much difference between 
global and native English topic models. For relevance modeling, 
Native English topic models are slightly worse than global models
. Arabic and Mandarin appear to show a native language advantage
for all cosine similarity conditions and most relevance 
model conditions. However, DET curves comparing global and 
native adapted models separately for English, Arabic, and Mandarin
, (Figure 3) show no real native language advantage.

breakdown for English, Arabic, and Mandarin

In trying to account for the discrepancy between the findings on 
link detection and tracking, we suspected that the root of the 
problem was the quality of native models for Arabic and Mandarin
. For English, adaptation began with 2 or 4 on-topic models. 
However, Mandarin and Arabic models did not begin with on-topic
stories; they could begin with off-topic models, which 
should hurt tracking performance. A related issue is data sparseness
. When a native topic model is first formed, it is based on one 
story, which is a poorer basis for tracking than N
t
stories. In the
next three sections we pursue different aspects of these suspicions. 
In section

5 we perform a best-case experiment, initializing native
topic sets with on-topic stories, and smoothing native scores with 
global scores to address the sparseness problem. If these conditions
do not show a native language advantage, we would reject 
the native language hypothesis. In section

6 we explore the role of
the adaptation threshold. In section

7 we compare some additional
methods of initializing native language topic models.
ON-TOPIC NATIVE CENTROIDS
In this section, we consider a best-case scenario, where we take 
the first N
t
stories in each language relevant to each topic, to initialize
adaptation of native topic models. While this is cheating, 
and not a way to obtain native training documents in a realistic 
tracking scenario, it demonstrates what performance can be attained
if native training documents are available. More realistic 
approaches to adapting native topic models are considered in 
subsequent sections.
The baseline and global adapted conditions were carried out as in 
Section

4, and the native adapted condition was similar except in
the way adaptation of native topics began. If there were not yet N
t

native stories in the topic set for the current test story in its native 
language, the story was added to the topic set if it was relevant. 
Once a native topic model had N
t
stories, we switched to the usual
non-cheating mode of adaptation, based on similarity score and 
adaptation threshold.
To address the data sparseness problem, we also smoothed the 
native similarity scores with the global similarity scores:

DET curves showing results computed separately for the three 
languages can be seen in Figure 5, for the cosine, N

be clearly seen that English tracking remains about the same but 
the Arabic and Mandarin native tracking show a large native language
advantage.
ADAPTATION THRESHOLD
The adaptation threshold was set to 0.5 in the experiments described
above without any tuning. The increase in global tracking 
performance after adaptation shows that the value is at least acceptable
. However, an analysis of the details of native adaptation 
showed that many Arabic and Mandarin topics were not adapting. 
A summary of some of this analysis can be seen in Table 8.

Fewer than a third of the topics received adapted stories. This 
means that for most topics, native tracking was based on the 
global models. In order to determine whether this was due to the 
adaptation threshold, we performed an experiment varying the 
adaptation threshold from .3 to .65 in steps of .05. The results can 
be seen in Figure 6, which shows the minimum cost, 
min(C
Det
)

, across the range of adaptation threshold values.
Although we see that the original threshold, .5, was not always the 
optimal value, it is also clear that the pattern we saw at .5 (and in 
Figure 6) does not change as the threshold is varied, that is tracking
with native topic models is not better than tracking with 
global models. An improperly tuned adaptation threshold was 
therefore not the reason that the native language hypothesis was 
not confirmed for tracking. We suspect that different adaptation 
thresholds may be needed for the different languages, but it would 
be better to handle this problem by language-specific normalization
of similarity scores.

IMPROVING NATIVE TOPIC MODELS
In the previous two sections we showed that when native topic 
models are initialized with language specific training stories that 
are truly on-topic, then topic tracking is indeed better with native 
models than with global models. However, in context of the TDT
407
test situation, the way we obtained our language-specific training 
stories was cheating.
In this section we experiment with 2 different "legal" ways to initialize
better native language models: (1) Use both global and 
native models, and smooth native similarity scores with global 
similarity scores. (2) Initialize native models with dictionary or 
other translations of the English training stories into the other 
language.
Smoothing was carried out in the native adapted condition according
to Equation (11), setting =0.5, without tuning. The comparison
with unadapted and globally adapted tracking can be seen 
in Table 9. The smoothing improves the native topic model performance
relative to unsmoothed native topic models (cf. Table 
5), and brings the native model performance to roughly the same 
level as the global. In other words, smoothing improves performance
, but we still do not have strong support for the native language
hypothesis. This is apparent in Figure 7. Native adapted 
tracking is not better than global adapted tracking.

The final method of initializing topic models for different languages
would be to translate the English training stories into the 
other languages required. We did not have machine translation 
from English into Arabic or Mandarin available for these experiments
. However, we have had success with dictionary translations 
for Arabic. In

[2] we found that dictionary translations from Arabic
into English resulted in comparable performance to the machine
translations on tracking, and better performance on link 
detection. Such translated stories would not be "native language" 
training stories, but might be a better starting point for language-specific
adaptation anyway.
Training story translations into Arabic used an English/Arabic 
probabilistic dictionary derived from the Linguistic Data Consor-tium's
UN Arabic/English parallel corpus, developed for our 
cross-language information retrieval work

[7]. Each English word
has many different Arabic translations, each with a translation 
probability  p(a|e). The Arabic words, but not the English words, 
have been stemmed according to a light stemming algorithm. To 
translate an English story, English stop words were removed, and 
each English word occurrence was replaced by all of its dictionary 
translations, weighted by their translation probabilities. Weights 
were summed across all the occurrences of each Arabic word, and 
the resulting Arabic term vector was truncated to retain only terms 
above a threshold weight. We translated training stories only into 
Arabic, because we did not have a method to produce good quality
English to Mandarin translation.
The results for Arabic can be seen in Table 10. For translation, it 
makes sense to include an unadapted native condition, labeled 
translated in the table.

The results are mixed. First of all, this case is unusual in that 
adaptation does not improve translated models. Further analysis 
revealed that very little adaptation was taking place. Because of 
this lack of native adaptation, global adaptation consistently outperformed
native adaptation here. However, in the unadapted 
conditions, translated training stories outperformed the global 
models for Arabic in three of the four cases - cosine N
t
=4 and
relevance models for N
t
=2 and N
t
=4 (the shaded baseline-trans-408
lated pairs in Table 10). The DET curve for the cosine N
t
=4 case
can be seen in Figure 8. The native unadapted curve is better 
(lower) than the global unadapted curve.
The translated stories were very different from the test stories, so 
their similarity scores almost always fell below the adaptation 
threshold. We believe the need to normalize scores between native 
stories and dictionary translations is part of the problem, but we 
also need to investigate the compatibility of the dictionary translations
with the native Arabic stories.
CONCLUSIONS
We have confirmed the native language hypothesis for story link 
detection. For topic tracking, the picture is more complicated. 
When native language training stories are available, good native 
language topic models can be built for tracking stories in their 
original language. Smoothing the native models with global models
improves performance slightly. However, if training stories are 
not available in the different languages, it is difficult to form native
models by adaptation or by translation of training stories, 
which perform better than the adapted global models.
Why should language specific comparisons be more accurate than 
comparisons based on machine translation? Machine translations 
are not always good translations. If the translation distorts the 
meaning of the original story, it is unlikely to be similar to the 
topic model, particularly if proper names are incorrect, or spelled 
differently in the machine translations than they are in the English 
training stories, a common problem in English translations from 
Mandarin or Arabic. Secondly, even if the translations are correct, 
the choice of words, and hence the language models, are likely to 
be different across languages. The second problem could be han-dled
by normalizing for source language, as in

[12]. But
normalization cannot compensate for poor translation.
We were surprised that translating the training stories into Arabic 
to make Arabic topic models did not improve tracking, but again, 
our dictionary based translations of the topic models were different
from native Arabic stories. We intend to try the same experiment
with manual translations of the training stories into Arabic 
and Mandarin.  We are also planning to investigate the best way 
to normalize scores for different languages. When TDT4 relevance
judgments are available we intend to replicate some of 
these experiments on TDT4 data.
