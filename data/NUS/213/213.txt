Web Taxonomy Integration through Co-Bootstrapping
ABSTRACT
We address the problem of integrating objects from a source 
taxonomy into a master taxonomy. This problem is not only 
currently pervasive on the web, but also important to the 
emerging semantic web. A straightforward approach to 
automating this process would be to learn a classifier that can 
classify objects from the source taxonomy into categories of the 
master taxonomy. The key insight is that the availability of the 
source taxonomy data could be helpful to build better classifiers 
for the master taxonomy if their categorizations have some 
semantic overlap. In this paper, we propose a new approach, co-bootstrapping
, to enhance the classification by exploiting such 
implicit knowledge. Our experiments with real-world web data 
show substantial improvements in the performance of taxonomy 
integration.

INTRODUCTION
A taxonomy, or directory or catalog, is a division of a set of 
objects (documents, images, products, goods, services, etc.) into 
a set of categories. There are a tremendous number of
taxonomies on the web, and we often need to integrate objects 
from a source taxonomy into a master taxonomy.

This problem is currently pervasive on the web, given that many 
websites are aggregators of information from various other 
websites [2]. A few examples will illustrate the scenario. A web 
marketplace like Amazon
1
may want to combine goods from
multiple vendors' catalogs into its own. A web portal like 
NCSTRL
2
may want to combine documents from multiple
libraries' directories into its own. A company may want to merge 
its service taxonomy with its partners'. A researcher may want to 
merge his/her bookmark taxonomy with his/her peers'.

, an innovative engineering education
and research collaboration among MIT, NUS and NTU, has a 
need to integrate the academic resource (courses, seminars, 
reports, softwares, etc.) taxonomies of these three universities.
This problem is also important to the emerging semantic web [4], 
where data has structures and ontologies describe the semantics 
of the data, thus better enabling computers and people to work in 
cooperation. On the semantic web, data often come from many 
different ontologies, and information processing across 
ontologies is not possible without knowing the semantic 
mappings between them. Since taxonomies are central 
components of ontologies, ontology mapping necessarily involves 
finding the correspondences between two taxonomies, which is 
often based on integrating objects from one taxonomy into the 
other and vice versa [10, 14].
If all taxonomy creators and users agreed on a universal standard, 
taxonomy integration would not be so difficult. But the web has 
evolved without central editorship. Hence the correspondences 
between two taxonomies are inevitably noisy and fuzzy. For 
illustration, consider the taxonomies of two web portals Google
4

and Yahoo

: what is "Arts/Music/Styles/" in one may be
"Entertainment/Music/Genres/" in the other, category 
"Computers_and_Internet/Software/Freeware" and category

"Computers/Open_Source/Software" have similar contents but 
show non-trivial differences, and so on. It is unclear if a 
universal standard will appear outside specific domains, and 
even for those domains, there is a need to integrate objects from 
legacy taxonomy into the standard taxonomy.
Manual taxonomy integration is tedious, error-prone, and clearly 
not possible at the web scale. A straightforward approach to 
automating this process would be to formulate it as a 
classification problem which has being well-studied in machine 
learning area [18]. Normally the classifier would be constructed 
using objects in the master taxonomy as training examples, and 
the source taxonomy would be completely ignored during 
learning. However, the availability of the source taxonomy data 
could be helpful to build better classifiers for the master 
taxonomy if their categorizations have some semantic overlap, 
particularly when the number of training examples is not very 
large.
Possible useful semantic relationships between a master category
C  and a source category  S  include:
·

C
S
=
(identical): an object belongs to C  if and only if it
belongs to  S ;
·

C
S
=

(mutual exclusion): if an object belongs to S  it
cannot belong to  C ;
·

C
S

(superset): any object that belonging to S  must  also
belong to  C ;
·

C
S

(subset): any object not belonging to S  also  cannot
belong to  C ;
·

C and S overlap but neither is a superset of the other.
In addition, semantic relationships may involve multiple master 
and source categories. For example, a master category  C  may be 
a subset of the union of two source categories
a
S
and
b
S
, so if
an object does not belong to either
a
S
or
b
S
, it cannot belong to
C . The real-world semantic relationships are noisy and fuzzy,
but they can still provide valuable information for classification. 
For example, knowing that most (80%) objects in a source 
category  S  belong to one master category
a
C
and the rest (20%)
examples belong to another master category
b
C
is  obviously
helpful. The difficulty is that knowledge about those semantic 
relationships is not explicit but hidden in the data.
In this paper, we propose a new approach, co-bootstrapping, to 
enhance the classification by exploiting such implicit knowledge. 
Our experiments with real-world web data show substantial 
improvements in the performance of taxonomy integration.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In §2, we give the 
formal problem statement. In §3, we describe a state-of-the-art 
solution. In §4, we present our approach in detail. In §5, we 
conduct experimental evaluations. In §6, we review the related 
work. In §7, we make concluding remarks.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Taxonomies are often organized as hierarchies. In this work, we 
assume for simplicity, that any objects assigned to an interior 
node really belong to a leaf node which is an offspring of that 
interior node. Since we now have all objects only at leaf nodes, 
we can flatten the hierarchical taxonomy to a single level and 
treat it as a set of categories [2].
Now we formally define the taxonomy integration problem that 
we are solving. Given two taxonomies:
·

a master taxonomy
M with a set of categories
1
2
,
,...,
M
C C
C

each containing a set of objects, and
·

a source taxonomy
N with a set of categories
1
2
,
,...,
N
S S
S

each containing a set of objects,
we need to find the categories in
M for each object in N.
To formulate taxonomy integration as a classification problem,
we take
1
2
,
,...,
M
C C
C
as classes, the objects in
M as training
examples, the objects in
N as test examples, so that taxonomy
integration can be automatically accomplished by predicting the 
classes of each test example. Such a classification problem is 
multi-class and multi-label, in the sense that there are usually 
more than two possible classes and one object may be relevant to 
more than one class.

A STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLUTION
Agrawal and Srikant recently proposed an elegant approach to 
taxonomy integration by enhancing the Naïve Bayes algorithm 
[2].
The Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithm is a well-known text 
classification technique [18]. NB tries to fit a generative model 
for documents using training examples and apply this model to 
classify test examples. The generative model of NB assumes that 
a document is generated by first choosing its class according to a 
prior distribution of classes, and then producing its words 
independently according to a (typically multinomial) distribution 
of terms conditioned on the chosen class [15]. Given a test 
document  d , NB predicts its class to be  arg max Pr[
| ]
C
C d
. The
posterior probability  Pr[
| ]
C d
can be computed via Bayes's rule:
Pr[

C d

is the number of occurrences of w  in  d . The

can be estimated by the proportion of training
documents in  C . The probability  Pr[ |

n C w

is the number of
occurrences of w  in training documents in C ,  V is the 
vocabulary of terms, and 0

&lt;
is the Lidstone's smoothing
parameter [1]. Taking logs, we see that NB is actually a linear 
classifier:

.
The enhanced Naïve Bayes (ENB) algorithm [2] uses the 
categorization of the source taxonomy to get better probability 
estimations. Given a test document d  that is know to be in
category  S  in
N, ENB predicts its category in M to be
arg max Pr[

C
C d S
. The posterior probability Pr[

C d S
can

be computed as Pr[

. ENB invokes a simplification that assumes  d
and  S  are independent given  C , therefore

is a parameter reflecting the
degree of semantic overlap between the categorizations of
M
and
N. The optimal value of

can be found using a tune set (a
set of objects whose categories in both taxonomies are known). 
The tune set can be made available via random sampling or 
active learning [2]. Taking logs, we see that ENB is still a linear 
classifier:

.
Comparing the classification functions of NB and ENB, it is 
obvious that all ENB does is to shift the classification threshold 
of its base NB classifier, no more and no less.
To achieve multi-class multi-label classification that is required 
by taxonomy integration, we use the "one-vs-rest" method to 
create an ensemble of binary (yes/no) NB or ENB classifiers, one
for each category  C  in
M.

OUR APPROACH
Here we present our approach in detail. In §4.1, we introduce the 
boosting technique. In §4.2, we propose the co-bootstrapping 
method. In §4.3, we discuss the advantages of our approach.
4.1

Boosting
In our approach to taxonomy integration, we utilize a powerful 
machine learning method, boosting [17, 23], to build classifiers. 
The main idea of boosting is to combine many weak hypotheses 
(simple and moderately accurate classification rules), into a 
highly accurate classifier. In this paper, we focus on boosting for 
text classification. Generalization to other kinds of data and 
learning algorithms would be straightforward.

in  x , i.e.,

4.1.2

Weak Hypotheses
Let
X  denote the domain of possible objects, and let  Y  be a set
of  k  possible classes. A labeled example is a pair  ( , )
x Y
where
x

X  is an object and Y

Y  is the set of classes which  x
belongs to. We define  [ ]
Y l
for  l

Y  to be
1  if
[ ]
1  if
l
Y
Y l
l
Y

.
A hypothesis is a real-valued function  :
h
×
R
X Y
. The sign
of  ( , )
h x l
is a prediction of  [ ]
Y l
for  x , i.e., whether object  x  is
contained in class  l . The magnitude of   ( , )
h x l
is interpreted as
a measure of confidence in the prediction.
Based on a binary feature  f , we are interested in weak
hypotheses  h  which are simple decision stumps of the form

AdaBoost Algorithm
The most popular boosting algorithm is AdaBoost introduced in 
1995 by Freund and Schapire [12]. Our work is based on a multi-class
multi-label version of AdaBoost, AdaBoost.MH [24, 25], 
which is described in Figure 1.

Given  m  training  examples

where  each

distribution
t

over all objects and classes. Initially this
distribution
1
D
is uniform. In the t-th round, the optimal weak
hypothesis
t
h
is selected based on the set of training examples
and the current distribution
t
D
. Then a parameter
t

is chosen,
and the distribution
t
D
is updated in a manner that puts more
weights on "difficult" examples (object-class pairs) that are 
misclassified by
t
h
. Please be referred to [24, 25] for the details
on computing optimal
t

and
t

rounds. The final hypothesis

4.2

Co-Bootstrapping
Thus far we have completely ignored the categorization of
N.
Although
M and N are usually not identical, their
categorizations often have some semantic overlap. Therefore the
categorization of
N contains valuable implicit knowledge about
the categorization of
M. Hereby we propose a new approach, co-bootstrapping
, to enhance the classification by exploiting such 
implicit knowledge.
4.2.1

Category-Features
If we have indicator functions for each category in
N, we can
imagine taking those indicator functions as features when we
learn the classifier for
M. This allows us to exploit the semantic
relationship among the categories of
M and N without
explicitly figuring out what the semantic relationships are. More
specifically, for each object in
M, we augment the ordinary
term-features with a set of category-features
1
2
{
,
...,
}
N
F
f
f
f
=
N
N
N

derived from
N. The category-feature
j
f
N
(1
)
j
N

of a given object  x
is a binary feature
indicating whether  x  belongs to category
j
S
(the  j-th category
of
N), i.e.,
1  if
0  if
j
j

f

N
.
In the same way, we can get a set of category-features
1
2
{
,
...,
}
M
F
f
f
f
=
M
M
M
M
derived  from
M to be used for
supplementing the features of objects in
N. The remaining
problem is to obtain these indicator functions, which are initially 
not available.
4.2.2

Co-Bootstrapping Algorithm
When building the classifier for
M, the training examples are
the objects in
M and the test examples are the objects in N. To
leverage the categorization of
N to reinforce classification, our
classifier uses term-features
T
F
as well as category-features
F
N
. However, we do not know the exact values of  F
N
of the
training examples.
Our proposed algorithm overcomes the above obstacle by
utilizing the bootstrapping idea. Let
( )
r
F
T
B
denote a boosting-classifier
for taxonomy
T's categorization based on feature set
F
at step  r . Initially we build a classifiers
0
(
)
T
F
B
N
based  on
only term-features, then use it to classify the objects in
M (the
training examples) into the categories of
N, thus we can predict
the value of each category-feature
j
f
F

N
N
for each object
x

M . At next step we will be able to build
1
(
)
T
F
F

M
N
B

using the predicted values of  F
N
of the training examples.
Similarly we can build
0
(
)
T
F
M
B
and
1
(
)
T
F
F

N
M
B
. The new
classifier

(
)
T
F
B
N

because
1
(

F

N
M
B
leverages more knowledge. Hence we
can predict the value of each category-feature
j
f
F

N
N
for
each object  x

M  more accurately using
1
(

T
F
F

instead of
0
(

T
F

, and afterwards we can build
2

T

. Also

Discussion
4.3.1

Why Choose Boosting
We have selected to employ the boosting technique to build 
classifiers in our co-bootstrapping approach to taxonomy 
integration because of its following virtues.
·

Boosting has shown outstanding classification performance on 
many kinds of data such as text documents [17, 23, 24].
·

Boosting finds the optimal combination of heterogeneous 
weak hypotheses automatically, therefore alleviates the 
problem of how to weight ordinary features (e.g. term-features) 
and category-features appropriately. In contrast, approaches 
based on other machine learning algorithms like Support 
Vector Machines (SVMs) [9] would require to adjust relative 
combination weights, which is a non-trivial problem.
·

Boosting generates descriptive and human-readable 
hypotheses as the final classifier, and the learned classifier is 
usually sparse despite the large feature set.
Although boosting looks an ideal choice, other machine learning 
algorithms can also be utilized in the co-bootstrapping approach. 
We have not investigated this issue yet.
4.3.2

Comparison with ENB
Although ENB [2] has been shown to work well for taxonomy 
integration, we think that a more general approach is still 
attractive. It has been experimentally shown that AdaBoost is 
more promising than NB for text classification [24]. The co-bootstrapping
approach allows more powerful machine learning 
algorithms like AdaBoost to be utilized.
Both ENB and our co-bootstrapping approach exploit the
categorization of
N to enhance classification. While all ENB
does is to shift the classification threshold of its base NB 
classifier (see §3), co-bootstrapping has the ability to achieve 
more complex adjustments on the classification function of its 
base classifier.
413
Furthermore, ENB needs a stand-alone tune set to find the 
optimal value of parameter

which controls the influence of
source categorization information on classification, whereas co-bootstrapping
based on boosting does not have such burdens.
Although co-bootstrapping looks more effective, ENB still holds 
an advantage in efficiency.
EXPERIMENTS
We have collected 5 datasets from Google and Yahoo. One 
dataset includes the slice of Google's taxonomy and the slice of 
Yahoo's taxonomy about websites on one specific topic, as 
shown in Table 1.

In each slice of taxonomy, we take only the top level directories 
as categories, e.g., the "Movie" slice of Google's taxonomy has 
categories like "Action", "Comedy", "Horror", etc.

For each dataset, we show in Table 2 the number of categories 
occurred in Google and Yahoo respectively.
In each category, we take all items listed on the corresponding 
directory page and its sub-directory pages as its objects. An 
object (list item) corresponds to a website on the world wide web, 
which is usually described by its URL, its title, and optionally a 
short annotation about its content. Here each object is considered 
as a text document composed of its title and annotation. All 
documents are pre-processed by removal of stop-words and 
stemming.

For each dataset, we show in Table 3 the number of objects 
occurred in Google (G), Yahoo (Y), either of them (G
Y), and
both of them (G
Y) respectively. The set of objects in GY
covers only a small portion (usually less than 10%) of the set of 
objects in Google or Yahoo alone, which suggests the great 
benefit of automatically integrating them. This observation is 
consistent with [2].

The number of categories per object in these datasets is 1.54 on 
average. This observation justifies the necessity of building 
multi-class multi-label classifiers.
5.2

Tasks
For each dataset, we pose 2 symmetric taxonomy integration 
tasks: G
Y (integrating objects from Yahoo into Google) and
Y
G (integrating objects from Google into Yahoo).
As described in §2, we formulate each task as a classification 
problem. The objects in G
Y can be used as test examples,
because their categories in both taxonomies are known to us [2]. 
We hide the test examples' master categories but expose their 
source categories to the learning algorithm in training phase, and 
then compare their hidden master categories with the predictions 
of the learning algorithm in test phase. Suppose the number of 
the test examples is  n . For G
Y tasks, we randomly sample  n
objects from the set G-Y as training examples. For Y
G tasks,
we randomly sample n  objects from the set Y-G as training 
examples. This is to simulate the common situation that the sizes
of
M and
N are roughly in same magnitude. For each task, we
do such random sampling 5 times, and report the classification 
performance averaged over these 5 random samplings.
5.3

Measures
As stated in §2, it is natural to accomplish taxonomy integration 
tasks via building multi-class multi-label classifiers. To measure
classification performance for each class (category in
M), we
use the standard F-score (F
1
measure) [3]. The F-score is defined
as the harmonic average of precision (p) and recall (r),
2
(
)
F
pr
p
r
=
+
, where precision is the proportion of correctly
predicted positive examples among all predicted positive 
examples, and recall is the proportion of correctly predicted 
positive examples among all true positive examples. The F-scores
can be computed for the binary decisions on each 
individual category first and then be averaged over categories. Or 
they can be computed globally over all the M
n
×
binary
decisions where  M  is the number of categories in consideration
(the number of categories in
M) and n  is the number of total
test examples (the number of objects in
N). The former way is
called  macro-averaging and the latter way is called micro-averaging
[27]. It is understood that the micro-averaged F-score 
(miF) tends to be dominated the classification performance on 
common categories, and that the macro-averaged F-score (maF) 
is more influenced by the classification performance on rare 
categories [27]. Providing both kinds of scores is more 
informative than providing either alone.
5.4

Settings
We use our own implementation of NB and ENB. The Lidstone's 
smoothing parameter

is set to an appropriate value 0.1 [1].
The performance of ENB would be greatly affected by its 
parameter

. We run ENB with a series of exponentially
increasing values of

: (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000) [2] for
each taxonomy integration task,  and report the best experimental 
results. We use BoosTexter [24] for the implementation of 
AdaBoost, taking single words as terms. We set the boosting
rounds
1000
T
=
and the co-bootstrapping iteration number
8
R
=
(see Figure 1 & 2). In the following sections, we denote
the normal AdaBoost approach by AB, and denote the co-bootstrapping
approach based on AdaBoost algorithm by CB-AB.
5.5

Results



The experimental results of NB and ENB are shown in Table 4. 
We see that ENB really can achieve much better performance 
than NB for taxonomy integration.

The experimental results of AB and CB-AB are shown in Table 5. 
Obviously AB beats NB, which is consistent with the conclusion 
of [24]. Also we find that CB-AB works better than AB for 
taxonomy integration, which suggests that co-bootstrapping
makes effective use of the categorization of
N to enhance
classification for
M.
Figure 4 shows that the taxonomy integration performance 
increases along with the number of co-bootstrapping iterations, 
on the Book dataset. This implies that the two boosting-classifiers
learned from two taxonomies do mutually boost each 
other until they become stable.


The experimental results of ENB and CB-AB are compared in 
Figure 5 and 6. It is clear that CB-AB outperforms ENB 
consistently and significantly.
RELATED WORK
Most of the recent research efforts related to taxonomy 
integration are in the context of ontology mapping on semantic 
web. An ontology specifies a conceptualization of a domain in
terms of concepts, attributes, and relations [11]. The concepts in 
an ontology are usually organized into a taxonomy: each concept 
is represented by a category and associated with a set of objects 
(called the extension of that concept). The basic goal of ontology 
mapping is to identify (typically one-to-one) semantic 
correspondences between the taxonomies of two given ontologies: 
for each concept (category) in one taxonomy, find the most 
similar concept (category) in the other taxonomy. Many works in 
this field use a variety of heuristics to find mappings [7, 16, 19, 
21]. Recently machine learning techniques have been introduced 
to further automate the ontology mapping process [10, 13, 14, 20, 
26]. Some of them derive similarities between concepts 
(categories) based on their extensions (objects) [10, 13, 14], 
therefore they need to first integrate objects from one taxonomy 
into the other and vice versa (i.e., taxonomy integration). So our 
work can be utilized as a basic component of an ontology 
mapping system.
As stated in §2, taxonomy integration can be formulated as a 
classification problem. The Rocchio algorithm [3, 22] has been 
applied to this problem in [14]; and the Naïve Bayes (NB) 
algorithm [18] has been applied to this problem in [10], without 
exploiting information in the source taxonomy. To our 
knowledge, the most advanced approach to taxonomy integration 
is the enhanced Naïve Bayes (ENB) algorithm proposed by 
Agrawal and Srikant [2], which we have reviewed and compared 
with our approach.
In [6], AdaBoost is selected as the framework to combine term-features
and automatically extracted semantic-features in the 
context of text categorization. We also choose AdaBoost to 
combine heterogeneous features (term-features and category-features
), but it is for a different problem (taxonomy integration) 
and it works in a more complex way (through co-bootstrapping).
In [8], an approach called co-boosting is proposed for named 
entity classification. Essentially co-boosting is a co-training [5] 
method that attempts to utilize unlabeled data to help 
classification through exploiting a particular form of redundancy 
in data: each instance is described by multiple views (disjoint 
feature sets) which are both compatible and uncorrelated 
(conditionally independent). However, the multi-view 
assumption does not hold in the context of taxonomy integration: 
the set of category features should not be considered as a view 
because category features alone are not sufficient for 
classification and they are strongly correlated with term features. 
In contrast to co-boosting (co-training), co-bootstrapping works 
with two taxonomies but not two views.
CONCLUSION
Our main contribution is to propose a new approach, co-bootstrapping
, that can effectively exploit the implicit knowledge 
in the source taxonomy to improve taxonomy integration.
The future work may include: theoretical analysis of the co-bootstrapping
approach, incorporating commonsense knowledge 
and domain constraints into the taxonomy integration process, 
and so forth.
