A Similarity Measure for Motion Stream Segmentation and Recognition
ABSTRACT
Recognition of motion streams such as data streams generated
by different sign languages or various captured human
body motions requires a high performance similarity measure
. The motion streams have multiple attributes, and motion
patterns in the streams can have different lengths from
those of isolated motion patterns and different attributes
can have different temporal shifts and variations. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a similarity measure
based on singular value decomposition (SVD) of motion matrices
. Eigenvector differences weighed by the corresponding
eigenvalues are considered for the proposed similarity measure
. Experiments with general hand gestures and human
motion streams show that the proposed similarity measure
gives good performance for recognizing motion patterns in
the motion streams in real time.

INTRODUCTION
Motion streams can be generated by continuously performed
sign language words [14] or captured human body
motions such as various dances. Captured human motions
can be applied to the movie and computer game industries
by reconstructing various motions from video sequences [10]
or images [15] or from motions captured by motion capture
systems [4]. Recognizing motion patterns in the streams
with unsupervised methods requires no training process, and
is very convenient when new motions are expected to be
added to the known pattern pools. A similarity measure
with good performance is thus necessary for segmenting and
recognizing the motion streams. Such a similarity measure
needs to address some new challenges posed by real world

motion streams: first, the motion patterns have dozens of attributes
, and similar patterns can have different lengths due
to different motion durations; second, different attributes of
similar motions have different variations and different temporal
shifts due to motion variations; and finally, motion
streams are continuous, and there are no obvious "pauses"
between neighboring motions in a stream. A good similarity
measure not only needs to capture the similarity of complete
motion patterns, but also needs to capture the differences
between complete motion patterns and incomplete motion
patterns or sub-patterns in order to segment a stream for
motion recognition.
As the main contribution of this paper, we propose a similarity
measure to address the above issues. The proposed
similarity measure is defined based on singular value decomposition
of the motion matrices. The first few eigenvectors
are compared for capturing the similarity of two matrices,
and the inner products of the eigenvectors are given different
weights for their different contributions. We propose to
use only the eigenvalues corresponding to the involved eigenvectors
of the two motion matrices as weights. This simple
and intuitive weighing strategy gives the same importance to
eigenvalues of the two matrices. We also show that the 95%
variance rule for choosing the number of eigenvectors [13] is
not sufficient for recognizing both isolated patterns and motion
streams. Our experiments demonstrate that at least the
first 6 eigenvectors need to be considered for motion streams
of either 22 attribute or 54 attributes, and the first 6 eigenvalues
accounts for more than 99.5% of the total variance in
the motion matrices.
RELATED WORK
Multi-attribute pattern similarity search, especially in continuous
motion streams, has been widely studied for sign
language recognition and for motion synthesis in computer
animation. The recognition methods usually include template
matching by distance measures and hidden Markov
models (HMM).
Template matching by using similarity/distance measures
has been employed for multi-attribute pattern recognition.
Joint angles are extracted in [11] as features to represent different
human body static poses for the Mahalanobis distance
measure of two joint angle features. Similarly, momentum,
kinetic energy and force are constructed in [2, 5] as activity
measure and prediction of gesture boundaries for various
segments of the human body, and the Mahalanobis distance
function of two composite features are solved by dynamic
programming.

Similarity measures are defined for multi-attribute data
in [6, 12, 16] based on principal component analysis (PCA).
Inner products or angular differences of principal components
(PCs) are considered for similarity measure definitions
, with different weighted strategies for different PCs.
Equal weights are considered for different combinations of
PCs in [6], giving different PCs equal contributions to the
similarity measure. The similarity measure in [12] takes the
minimum of two weighted sums of PC inner products, and
the two sums are respectively weighted by different weights.
A global weight vector is obtained by taking into account all
available isolated motion patterns in [16], and this weight
vector is used for specifying different contributions from different
PC inner products to the similarity measure Eros.
The dominating first PC and a normalized eigenvalue vector
are considered in [7, 8] for pattern recognition. In contrast,
this paper propose to consider the first few PCs, and the
angular differences or inner products of different PCs are
weighted by different weights which depends on the data
variances along the corresponding PCs.
The HMM technique has been widely used for sign language
recognition, and different recognition rates have been
reported for different sign languages and different feature selection
approaches. Starner et al. [14] achieved 92% and 98%
word accuracy respectively for two systems, the first of the
systems used a camera mounted on a desk and the second
one used a camera in a user's cap for extracting features
as the input of HMM. Similarly Liang and Ouhyoung [9]
used HMM for postures, orientations and motion primitives
as features extracted from continuous Taiwan sign language
streams and an average 80.4% recognition rate was achieved.
In contrast, the approach proposed in this paper is an unsupervised
approach, and no training as required for HMM
recognizers is needed.
SIMILARITY MEASURE FOR MOTION STREAM RECOGNITION
The joint positional coordinates or joint angular values of
a subject in motion can be represented by a matrix: the
columns or attributes of the matrix are for different joints,
and the rows or frames of the matrix are for different time
instants. Similarity of two motions is the similarity of the
resulting motion matrices, which have the same number of
attributes or columns, and yet can have different number
of rows due to different motion durations. To capture the
similarity of two matrices of different lengths, we propose
to apply singular value decomposition (SVD) to the motion
matrices in order to capture the similarity of the matrix
geometric structures. Hence we briefly present SVD and its
associated properties below before proposing the similarity
measure based on SVD in this section.
3.1
Singular Value Decomposition
The geometric structure of a matrix can be revealed by
the SVD of the matrix. As shown in [3], any real m ╫ n
matrix A can be decomposed into A = U V
T
, where U =
[u

and V = [v

n╫n
are two orthogonal matrices, and  is a diagonal matrix with
diagonal entries being the singular values of A:
1

2

. . .

min(m,n)
0. Column vectors u
i
and v
i
are the i
th
left and right singular vectors of A, respectively.
It can be shown that the right singular vectors of the sym-metric
n ╫ n matrix M = A
T
A
are identical to the corresponding
right singular vectors of A, referred to as eigenvectors
of M . The singular values of M , or eigenvalues of M ,
are squares of the corresponding singular values of A. The
eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue gives the first principal
component. The eigenvector with the second largest
eigenvalue is the second principal component and so on.
3.2
Similarity Measure
Since SVD exposes the geometric structure of a matrix, it
can be used for capturing the similarity of two matrices. We
can compute the SVD of M = A
T
A
instead of computing
the SVD of A to save computational time. The reasons are
that the eigenvectors of M are identical to the corresponding
right singular vectors of A, the eigenvalues of M are the
squares of the corresponding singular values of A, and SVD
takes O(n
3
) time for the n ╫ n M and takes O(mn
2
) time
with a large constant for the m ╫ n A, and usually m &gt; n.
Ideally, if two motions are similar, their corresponding
eigenvectors should be parallel to each other, and their corresponding
eigenvalues should also be proportional to each
other. This is because the eigenvectors are the corresponding
principal components, and the eigenvalues reflect the
variances of the matrix data along the corresponding principal
components. But due to motion variations, all corresponding
eigenvectors cannot be parallel as shown in Figure
1. The parallelness or angular differences of two eigenvectors
u and v can be described by the absolute value of
their inner products: | cos | = |u ╖ v|/(|u||v|) = |u ╖ v|, where
|u| = |v| = 1. We consider the absolute value of the inner
products because eigenvectors can have different signs
as shown in [8].
Since eigenvalues are numerically related to the variances
of the matrix data along the associated eigenvectors, the importance
of the eigenvector parallelness can be described by
the corresponding eigenvalues. Hence, eigenvalues are to be
used to give different weights to different eigenvector pairs.
Figure 2 shows that the first eigenvalues are the dominating
components of all the eigenvalues, and other eigenvalues
become smaller and smaller and approach zero. As the
eigenvalues are close to zero, their corresponding eigenvectors
can be very different even if two matrices are similar.
Hence not all the eigenvectors need to be incorporated into
the similarity measure.
Since two matrices have two eigenvalues for the corresponding
eigenvector pair, these two eigenvalues should have
equal contributions or weights to the eigenvector parallelness
. In addition, the similarity measure of two matrices
should be independent to other matrices, hence only eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of the two matrices should be considered
.
Based on the above discussions, we propose the following
similarity measure for two matrices Q and P :

54) in Section 4 show that k = 6 is large enough without
loss of pattern recognition accuracy in streams. We refer to
this non-metric similarity measure as k Weighted Angular
Similarity (kWAS) , which captures the angular similarities
of the first k corresponding eigenvector pairs weighted by
the corresponding eigenvalues.
It can be easily verified that the value of kWAS ranges over
[0,1]. When all corresponding eigenvectors are normal to
each other, the similarity measure will be zero, and when two
matrices are identical, the similarity measure approaches the
maximum value one if k approaches n.

Stream Segmentation Algorithm
In order to recognize motion streams, we assume one motion
in a stream has a minimum length l and a maximum
length L. The following steps can be applied to incremen-tally
segment a stream for motion recognition:
1. SVD is applied to all isolated motion patterns P to
obtain their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Let  be
the incremented stream length for segmentation, and
let L be the location for segmentation. Initially L = l.
2. Starting from the beginning of the stream or the end of
the previously recognized motion, segment the stream
at location L. Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the motion segment Q.
3. Compute kWAS between Q and all motion patterns
P
. Update
max
to be the highest similarity after the
previous motion's recognition.
4. If L+ &lt; L, update L = L+ and go to step 2. Otherwise
, the segment corresponding to
max
is recognized
to be the motion pattern which gives the highest similarity
max
, update L = l starting from the end of the
last recognized motion pattern and go to step 2.

eigenvalues, and the sum of the first 6 eigenvalues is
almost 100% of the total eigenvalues.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
This section evaluates experimentally the performances
of the similarity measure kWAS proposed in this paper. It
has been shown in [16] that Eros [16] outperforms other
similarity measures mentioned in Section 2 except MAS [8].
Hence in this section, we compare the performances of the
proposed kWAS with Eros and MAS for recognizing similar
isolated motion patterns and for segmenting and recognizing
motion streams from hand gesture capturing CyberGlove
and human body motion capture system.
4.1
Data Generation
A similarity measure should be able to be used not only
for recognizing isolated patterns with high accuracy, but also
for recognizing patterns in continuous motions or motion
streams. Recognizing motion streams is more challenging
than recognizing isolated patterns. This is because many
very similar motion segments or sub-patterns needs to be
compared in order to find appropriate segmentation locations
, and a similarity measure should capture the difference
between a complete motion or pattern and its sub-patterns.
Hence, both isolated motion patterns and motion streams
were generated for evaluating the performance of kWAS.
Two data sources are considered for data generation: a CyberGlove
for capturing hand gestures and a Vicon motion
capture system for capturing human body motions.
4.1.1
CyberGlove Data
A CyberGlove is a fully instrumented data glove that provides
22 sensors for measuring hand joint angular values to
capture motions of a hand, such as American Sign Language
(ASL) words for hearing impaired. The data for a hand gesture
contain 22 angular values for each time instant/frame,
one value for a joint of one degree of freedom. The motion
data are extracted at around 120 frames per second.
Data matrices thus have 22 attributes for the CyberGlove
motions.
One hundred and ten different isolated motions were generated
as motion patterns, and each motion was repeated
for three times, resulting in 330 isolated hand gesture motions
. Some motions have semantic meanings. For example,
91
the motion for BUS as shown in Table 1 is for the ASL sign
"bus". Yet for segmentation and recognition, we only require
that each individual motion be different from others,
and thus some motions are general motions, and do not have
any particular semantic meanings, such as the THUMBUP
motion in Table 1.
The following 18 motions shown in Table 1 were used to
generate continuous motions or streams. Twenty four different
motion streams were generated for segmentation and
recognition purpose. There are 5 to 10 motions in a stream
and 150 motions in total in 24 streams, with 6.25 motions in
a stream on average. It should be noted that variable-length
transitional noises occur between successive motions in the
generated streams.

4.1.2
Motion Capture Data
The motion capture data come from various motions captured
collectively by using 16 Vicon cameras and the Vicon
iQ Workstation software. A dancer wears a suit of non-reflective
material and 44 markers are attached to the body
suit. After system calibration and subject calibration, global
coordinates and rotation angles of 19 joints/segments can
be obtained at about 120 frames per second for any motion
. Similarity of patterns with global 3D positional data
can be disguised by different locations, orientations or different
paths of motion execution as illustrated in Figure 3(a).
Since two patterns are similar to each other because of similar
relative positions of corresponding body segments at
corresponding time, and the relative positions of different
segments are independent of locations or orientations of the
body, we can transform the global position data into local
position data as follows.
Let X
p
, Y
p
, Z
p
be the global coordinates of one point on
pelvis, the selected origin of the "moving" local coordinate
system, and , ,  be the rotation angles of the pelvis segment
relative to the global coordinate system axes, respectively

Let X, Y, Z be the global coordinates of one point on any
segments, and x, y, z be the corresponding transformed local
coordinates. x, y and z can be computed as follows:
[x y z 1] = [X Y Z 1] ╫ T ╫ R
The transformed data are positions of different segments
relative to a moving coordinate system with the origin at
some fixed point of the body, for example the pelvis. The
moving coordinate system is not necessarily aligned with
the global system, and it can rotate with the body. So data
transformation includes both translation and rotation, and
the transformed data would be translation and rotation invariant
as shown in Figure 3(b). The coordinates of the
origin pelvis are not included, thus the transformed matrices
have 54 columns.
Sixty two isolated motions including Taiqi, Indian dances,
and western dances were performed for generating motion
capture data, and each motion was repeated 5 times, yielding
310 isolated human motions. Every repeated motion has
a different location and different durations, and can face
different orientations. Twenty three motion streams were
generated for segmentation. There are 3 to 5 motions in
a stream, and 93 motions in total in 23 streams, with 4.0
motions in a stream on average.

WAS for Capturing Similarities
and Segmenting Streams
We first apply kWAS to isolated motion patterns to show
that the proposed similarity measure kWAS can capture the
similarities of isolated motion patterns. Then kWAS is applied
to motion streams for segmenting streams and recognizing
motion patterns in the streams. We experimented
with different k values in order to find out the smallest k
without loss of good performance.

averaged on 330 hand gestures and 310 human motions, respectively

more than 95% of the respective sums of all eigenvalues,
considering only the first two eigenvectors for kWAS is not
sufficient as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. For CyberGlove
data with 22 attributes, kWAS with k = 3 gives the
same performance as kWAS with k = 22, and for motion
capture data with 54 attributes, kWAS with k = 5 gives the
same performance as kWAS with k = 54. Figure 4 and Figure
5 illustrate that kWAS can be used for finding similar
motion patterns and outperforms MAS and Eros for both
hand gesture and human body motion data.
The steps in Section 3.3 are used for segmenting streams
and recognizing motions in streams. The recognition accuracy
as defined in [14] is used for motion stream recognition.
The motion recognition accuracies are shown in Table 2. For
both CyberGlove motion and captured motion data, k = 6
is used for kWAS, which gives the same accuracy as k = 22
for CyberGlove data and k = 54 for motion capture data,
respectively.
Figure 6 shows the time taken for updating the candidate
segment, including updating the matrix, computing the
SVD of the updated matrix, and computing the similarities
of the segment and all motion patterns. The code implemented
in C++ was run on one 2.70 GHz Intel processor
of a GenuineIntel Linux box. There are 22 attributes for
the CyberGlove streams, and 54 attributes for the captured

Discussions
k
WAS captures the similarity of square matrices of two
matrices P and Q, yet the temporal order of pattern execution
is not revealed in the square matrices. As shown in [7],
two matrices with the identical row vectors in different orders
have identical eigenvectors and identical eigenvalues. If
different temporal orders of pattern execution yield patterns
with different semantic meanings, we need to further consider
the temporal execution order, which is not reflected in
the eigenvectors and eigenvalues and has not been considered
previously in [6, 12, 16].
Since the first eigenvectors are close or parallel for similar
patterns, we can project pattern A onto its first eigenvector
u
1
by Au
1
. Then similar patterns would have similar projections
(called projection vectors hereafter), showing similar
temporal execution orders while the projection variations
for each pattern can be maximized. The pattern projection
vectors can be compared by computing their dynamic time
warping (DTW) distances, for DTW can align sequences
of different lengths and can be solved easily by dynamic
programming [1]. Incorporating temporal order information
into the similarity measure can be done as for MAS in [7]
if motion temporal execution orders cause motion pattern
ambiguity to kWAS.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper has proposed a similarity measure kWAS for
motion stream segmentation and motion pattern recognition
. kWAS considers the first few k eigenvectors and computes
their angular similarities/differences, and weighs contributions
of different eigenvector pairs by their correspond-93
ing eigenvalues. Eigenvalues from two motion matrices are
given equal importance to the weights. Experiments with
CyberGlove hand gesture streams and captured human body
motions such as Taiqi and dances show that kWAS can recognize
100% most similar isolated patterns and can recognize
94% motion patterns in continuous motion streams.
