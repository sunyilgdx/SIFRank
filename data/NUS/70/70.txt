DirectoryRank: Ordering Pages in Web Directories
ABSTRACT
Web Directories are repositories of Web pages organized in a hierarchy
of topics and sub-topics. In this paper, we present DirectoryRank
, a ranking framework that orders the pages within a given
topic according to how informative they are about the topic. Our
method works in three steps: first, it processes Web pages within a
topic in order to extract structures that are called lexical chains,
which are then used for measuring how informative a page is for a
particular topic. Then, it measures the relative semantic similarity of
the pages within a topic. Finally, the two metrics are combined for
ranking all the pages within a topic before presenting them to the
users.

INTRODUCTION
A Web Directory is a repository of Web pages that are organized in
a topic hierarchy. Typically, Directory users locate the information
sought simply by browsing through the topic hierarchy, identifying
the relevant topics and finally examining the pages listed under the
relevant topics. Given the current size and the high growth rate of
the Web [10], a comprehensive Web Directory may contain thousands
of pages within a particular category. In such a case, it might
be impossible for a user to look through all the relevant pages
within a particular topic in order to identify the ones that best represent
the current topic. Practically, it would be more time-efficient
for a user to view the Web pages in order of importance for a particular
topic, rather than go through a large list of pages. 
One way to alleviate this problem is to use a ranking function which
will order the pages according to how "informative" they are of the
topic that they belong to. Currently, the Open Directory Project [3]
lists the pages within a category alphabetically, while the Google
Directory [1] orders the pages within a category according to their
PageRank [11] value on the Web. While these rankings can work
well in some cases, they do not directly capture the closeness of the
pages to the topic that they belong to. 
In this paper, we present DirectoryRank, a new ranking framework
that we have developed in order to alleviate the problem of ranking
the pages within a topic based on how "informative" these pages
are to the topic. DirectoryRank is based on the intuition that the
quality (or informativeness) of a Web page with respect to a particular
topic is determined by the amount of information that the
page communicates about the given topic, relative to the other
pages that are categorized in the same topic. Our method takes as
input a collection of Web pages that we would like to rank along
with a Web Directory's topic hierarchy that we would like to use.
At a high level, our method proceeds as follows: first, we identify
the most important words inside every page and we link them together
, creating "lexical chains". We then use the topic hierarchy
and the pages' lexical chains to compute the "relatedness" (or importance
) of the pages to each of their corresponding topics. Having
determined the pages' topic importance, we measure the relative
semantic similarity among the pages that relate to the same topic.
The semantic similarity indicates the amount of content that important
pages in some topic share with each other. Finally, we employ
our DirectoryRank algorithm that uses the topic importance scores
in conjunction with the semantic similarities of the pages in order to
compute the ranking order of the pages within a Directory topic. 
In order to study the effectiveness of DirectoryRank in identifying
the most informative pages within a particular topic, we applied our
method to the ranking of 318,296 Web pages listed in 156 topics in
the Google Directory. We have compared the rankings induced by
DirectoryRank to the rankings induced by PageRank for the pages
listed in those 156 topics. Our comparison reveals that the two
rankings have different merits and thus they are useful in different
tasks. To delve into the two rankings' effectiveness and investigate
which is more useful for ordering pages in Directories' topics, we
conducted a user study, where we asked a group of individuals to
compare the rankings delivered by PageRank to the rankings delivered
by DirectoryRank, and indicate which of the two is deemed as
more useful. Our results show that, in most cases, the users perceived
DirectoryRank to be more topic-informative than PageRank. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We start our discussion
in Section 2 with a brief introduction to PageRank, which is
currently employed by the Google Directory in order to rank pages.
In Section 3, we briefly present the topic hierarchy that we use in
our study as well as the process we follow for representing Web
pages into lexical chains. We also show how we explore the topic

hierarchy and the pagers' lexical chains for measuring the pages'
topic-importance and semantic similarities values. Finally, we present
how our DirectoryRank metric employs the above values for
measuring how informative Web pages are with respect to some
topics and rank them accordingly. In Section 4, we experimentally
study the effectiveness of DirectoryRank, by comparing its performance
to PageRank. We revise related work in Section 5 and we
conclude the paper in Section 6.
OVERVIEW OF PAGERANK
In this section, we briefly explain the main intuition of PageRank, a
metric that was primarily invented for ranking pages within the
Google Search Engine and that is currently used within the Google
Directory for ordering Web pages. For a more elaborate overview
on PageRank, we refer the reader to the work of [11]. The intuition
of PageRank metric is that a page on the Web is important if there
are a lot of other important pages pointing to it. That is, if a page p
has many links from other important pages, we may conclude that
this page is interesting to many people and that it should be considered
as being "important" or of "good" quality. Similarly, if an
important page has links to other pages, we expect that part of its
quality is transferred to the pages it points to, which in turn become
of increased significance/quality. Roughly, PageRank PR(p) defines
the importance of page p to be the sum of the importance of the
pages that endorse p. At a high level, PageRank is calculating the
probability that a "random surfer" is looking at a given page at a
given point of time. The "random surfer" is a mathematical model
that emulates the behavior of a user that, given a page, follows an
outgoing link from that page at random. Formally, given a page p
i

that has incoming links from the pages p
1

and let c

be the
number of out-links from p

where  d corresponds to the probability that the random surfer will
get bored and his next visit will be a completely random page, and
1-d corresponds to the probability that the page the random surfer
will pick for his next visit is an outgoing link of the current page.
DIRECTORY RANK
The ranking of a Web page within a particular topic intuitively
depends on two criteria: (i) the importance of the page for the underlying
topic. This criterion helps us identify the most important
pages out of the several ones that may lie within a particular topic.
(ii) the semantic correlation of a page relative to other important
pages in the same topic. This criterion helps us rank pages relative
to each other within a topic. For measuring the importance of a
Web page in some topic, we explore a subject hierarchy that we
have built in the course of an earlier study [13] and we use the lexical
chaining technique for identifying the most important words
inside the page. 
We start our discussion with a presentation of the topic hierarchy
that we use in our work (Section 3.1) and we describe the process
we follow for representing Web pages into lexical chains (Section
3.2). We also explain how we utilize the topic hierarchy and the
pages' lexical chains for measuring the pages' importance to the
hierarchy's topics (Section 3.2.1). The contribution of our work lies
in the exploitation of the topic hierarchy and the lexical chains that
we generate for representing Web pages in order to compute the
semantic similarities between the pages that are important in some
topics. Moreover, we have developed a novel framework, which
employs the pages' topic importance and semantic similarity measures
for ranking pages inside Directory topics.
3.1  The Topic Hierarchy
The main intuition in our DirectoryRank metric is that topic relevance
estimation of a Web page relies on the page's lexical coherence
, i.e. having a substantial portion of words associated with the
same topic. To capture this property, we adopt the lexical chaining
approach: for every Web page we generate a sequence of semantically
related terms, known as lexical chain. In our approach of representing
Web pages into lexical chains, we adopt the method reported
in [6], which uses WordNet [5] as the knowledge base for
providing information about the semantic relations that exist between
the words in a text. A detailed description of the lexical
chains' generation process is given in Section 3.2. Before that, we
present the topic hierarchy that we use for determining the topics
that are associated with the contents (i.e. words) of Web pages. 
Since we are mainly interested in measuring the Web pages' importance
in the context of Web Directories, we decided to demonstrate
the usefulness of our DirectoryRank metric in ordering Web pages
in the topics currently used in a real Web Directory. To that end, we
applied DirectoryRank to the main topics used in the Google Directory
. Google Directory provides a hierarchical listing of Web pages
categorized by topic and reuses the data maintained by the Open
Directory Project. Moreover, since DirectoryRank relies on the
Web pages' lexical chains rather than their entire contents for
measuring the pages' importance to particular topics and since lexical
chain generation is dependent on WordNet, we decided to enrich
the top level (main) topics of the Google Directory with their
respective WordNet lexical hierarchies. 
The first step we took for enriching the Google topics with WordNet
data was to examine the compatibility between these topics and
the topics used to annotate WordNet's concepts with domain information
. Note that the topic information that exists in the labels of
WordNet's contents is taken from the freely available Suggested
Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) [4] and the MultiWordNet Domains
(MWND) [2]. Due to space limitations, here we present a
summary of our approach into enriching the Google topics with
WordNet hierarchies. A detailed description of the process we followed
for appending to the Google top level topics their corresponding
WordNet hierarchies is given in [13]. In brief, we located
the Google's top level topics among the topics used in either
SUMO or MWND for annotating WordNet concepts. Out of the 17
Google topics, 13 topics (shown in Table 1) are used for labeling
WordNet concepts with topic information. To each of those 13
topics, we integrated their corresponding sub-topics that we ac-quired
from either SUMO or MWND. The sub-topic integration
was performed automatically, simply by following WordNet's hyper/hyponymy
links. At the end of this process, we came down to a
hierarchy of 489 sub-topics, which are organized into the 13 top
level topics that we used from Google Directory.

In Section 3.4, we will demonstrate how to use our topic hierarchy
for automating the task of ranking pages within topical categories.

3.2  Measuring Web Pages' Topic Importance
The computational model that we adopted for generating lexical
chains is presented in the work of Barzilay [6] and it generates lexical
chains in a three step approach: (i) it selects a set of candidate
terms
1
from a page, (ii) for each candidate term, it finds an appropriate
chain relying on a relatedness criterion among members of
the chains, and (iii) if such a chain is found, it inserts the term in the
chain. The relatedness factor in the second step is determined by the
type of WordNet links that connect the candidate term to the terms
stored in existing lexical chains. Figure 1 illustrates an example of
the lexical chain generated for a text containing the candidate terms:
system, network, sensor, weapon, missile, surface and net. The
subscript si denotes the id of the word's sense within WordNet.

Figure 1. An example of a lexical chain.
Having generated lexical chains, we disambiguate the sense of the
words inside every chain by employing the scoring function f introduced
in [12], which indicates the probability that a word relation is
a correct one.  
Given two words, w
1
and w
2
, their scoring function f via a relation
r, depends on the words' association score, their depth in WordNet
and their respective relation weight. The association score (Assoc)
of the word pair (w
1
, w
2
) is determined by the words' co-occurrence
frequency in a corpus that has been previously collected. In practice
, the greater the association score between a word pair w
1
and w
2
is, the greater the likelihood that w
1
and w
2
refer to the same topic.
Formally, the (Assoc) score of the word pair (w

) is given by:

where  Depth (w) is the depth of word w in WordNet. Semantic

to 1 for reiteration, 0.2 for synonymy and hyper/hyponymy, 0.3 for 
antonymy, 0.4 for mero/holonymy and 0.005 for siblings. The scoring

The value of the function f represents the probability that the relation

As candidate terms, we use nouns and proper names because they
convey the vast majority of conceptual information in texts.
Eventually, in order to disambiguate we will pick the relations and 
senses that maximize the Score (C
i
) for that particular chain. In
estimating the importance of a Web page p
i
in some Directory's
topic T
k
our first step is to identify which node within the hierarchy
(see Section 3.1) corresponds to topic T
k
of the page.
3.2.1 Topic-Importance Scoring
Once the topic of a page is located among the hierarchy's topics, we 
map the words in the page's lexical chain to the WordNet nodes 
under that particular topic. Recall that upon lexical chain generation
, words are disambiguated ensuring that every word inside a 
page is mapped to a single word within the WordNet hierarchy. We 
then determine the importance of a page p
i
to topic T
k
by counting
the number of words in the lexical chain of p
i
that are subsumed by
T
k
in the hierarchy's graph. The topic importance of a page is given
by a Relatedness Score (RScore), which indicates how relevant a 
page is for a given topic. Formally, the relatedness score of a page 
p
i
(represented by the lexical chain C
i
) to the hierarchy's topic T
k
is
defined as the product of the page's chain Score (C
i
) and the fraction
of words in the page's chain that are descendants of T
k
. Formally
, the RScore is given by:
RScore (C
i
, T
k
) =
k
i
i
i
Score(C )    common C and T  elements
C elements
·

The denominator is used to remove any effect the length of a lexical 
chain might have on
RScore and ensures that the final score is normalized
so that all values are between 0 and 1, with 0 corresponding
to no relatedness at all and 1 indicating the page that is highly 
expressive of the page's topic. The
RScore of a page to a specific
topic captures the importance of the page in the given topic.
3.3  Semantic Similarity Scoring
The relatedness score metric that we have just presented can serve 
as a good indicator for identifying the most important pages within 
a topic. However, the
RScore metric does not capture the amount of
common content that is shared between the Web pages in a topic. 
This is important in the cases where our topic-importance scoring 
gives a low score for some pages but, at the same time, these pages 
are very similar to other pages with high topic-importance scores. 
In order to accommodate for this scenario, we now show how to 
compute the semantic similarities among the pages that are listed in 
the same Directory topic. Semantic similarity is indicative of the 
pages' semantic correlation and helps in determining the ordering 
of the pages that are deemed important in some topic. Our DirectoryRank
metric employs the Web page's topic-importance scores 
and their semantic similarities to determine their ranking order inside
some Directory topics and is presented in the next section.
In order to estimate the Web pages' semantic similarity, we compare
the elements in a page's lexical chain to the elements in the 
lexical chains of the other pages in a Directory topic. We assume 
that if the chains of two Web pages have a large number of elements
in common, then the pages are correlated to each other. To 
compute similarities between pages,
p
i
and
p
j
that are categorized in
the same topic, we first need to identify the common elements between
their lexical chains, represented as
PC
i
and
PC
j,
respectively.
First, we use WordNet to augment the elements of the lexical chains 
PC
i
and
PC
j
with their synonyms. Chain augmentation ensures that
pages of comparable content are not regarded unrelated, if their 
lexical chains contain distinct, but semantically equivalent elements
. The augmented elements of
PC
i
and
PC
j
are defined as:

tuples of the form &lt;

where, the degree of semantic similarity is normalized so that all 
values are between zero and one, with 0 indicating that the two 
pages are totally different and 1 indicating that the two pages talk 
about the same thing.
3.4 DirectoryRank Scoring
Pages are sorted in Directory topics on the basis of a DirectoryRank 
metric, which defines the importance of the pages with respect to 
the particular topics in the Directory. DirectoryRank (
DR) measures
the quality of a page in some topic by the degree to which the page 
correlates to other informative/qualitative pages in the given topic. 
Intuitively, an informative page in a topic, is a page that has a high 
relatedness score to the Directory's topic and that is semantically 
close (similar) to many other pages in that topic.
DR defines the
quality of a page to be the sum of its topic relatedness score and its 
overall similarity to the fraction of pages with which it correlates in 
the given topic. This way, if a page is highly related to topic
D and
also correlates highly with many informative pages in
D, its DR
score will be high. Formally, consider that page
p

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
To measure the potential of our DirectoryRank metric in delivering 
topic-informative rankings, we conducted an experiment, where we 
studied the effectiveness of
DR in prioritizing the most informative
pages in some Directory's topics. To obtain perceptible evidence of 
DirectoryRank's efficiency in a practical setting, we applied our
DR
metric to a set of Web pages listed in a number of topics in Google 
Directory and we compared the rankings induced by DirectoryRank 
to the rankings that Google Directory delivers for the same set of 
pages and topics. In Section 4.1 we explain how we selected the 
pages for our study, while in Section 4.2 we present the similarity 
measure that we used for comparing the rankings induced by DirectoryRank
to the rankings delivered by PageRank, and we give obtained
results. Moreover, to delve into the behavior of DirectoryRank
we carried out a user study, presented in Section 4.3.
4.1 Experimental Dataset
In selecting our experimental data, we picked pages that are categorized
in those topics in Google Directory, which are also present in 
our hierarchy. Recall that Google Directory is a replica of the Dmoz 
Directory, from which we borrowed our hierarchy's 13 top-level 
topics. Out of all the sub-topics organized in those 13 top-level 
topics in Google Directory, 156 were represented in our hierarchy. 
Having determined the topics, whose set of ranked pages would be 
compared, we downloaded a total number of 318,296 pages, categorized
in one of the 156 selected topics, which in turn are organized
into the 13 top-level topics. Table 2 shows the distribution of 
the experimental pages in the top level topics in Google Directory.

Since we were interested in comparing DirectoryRank with PageRank
, in the context of ranking Web pages in Directory topics, we 
recorded for the downloaded Web pages their relative ranking order 
in Google Directory in each of the 156 selected topics. We then 
stored the downloaded pages in a secondary index, maintaining 
their relative PageRank rankings. To compute the
DR values for
every experimental page, we initially processed the downloaded 
pages in order to generate and score their lexical chains. For every 
page, we first computed its
RScore to the topic in which it is assigned
in Google Directory, and then we computed the semantic 
similarity (

s
) for every pair of pages listed in each topic. Lastly,
using the above two scores (i.e. semantic similarity and topic relatedness
), we computed for every Web page its DirectoryRank (
DR)
value and we sorted the pages listed within each of the topics, so 
that pages with higher
DR scores in some topic are prioritized
among the set of topic related pages. Using the above data, we 
evaluated the effectiveness of our DirectoryRank metric in ordering 
Web pages inside the Directory's topics.
4.2  Overlap of DirectoryRank and PageRank
To investigate whether there is any similarity between the rankings 
induced by DirectoryRank and the rankings delivered by PageRank 
for our experimental pages in the 156 topics in Google Directory, 
we used the
OSim measure, reported in the work of [9], which indicates
the degree of overlap between the top
n URLs of the two
rankings. Formally, the overlap of two ranked lists A and B (each of 
size
n) is given by:
(
)
,
/
OSim DR PR
A
B n

=
I

Using the above formula, we computed for each of the 156 topics 
the overlap between the pages ranked in the top n=10 positions for 
that topic by
DR and PR respectively. Afterwards, we first com-20
puted the average similarity between the two induced rankings for 
each of the 156 selected topics, and then the average similarity between
the two induced rankings for each of the 13 top-level topics. 
To compute the average similarity between
DR and PR for a top
level topic
T, we summed the average similarity of all sub-topics in
T and we divided by the number of sub-topics that T has. Table 3 
gives the average similarity scores between
DR and PR for each of
the 13 top-level topics examined in our experiment.

Obtained results demonstrate that there is little average overlap 
between the top 10 results for the two rankings. Note that for some 
topics we compared the overlap between
DR and PR for a larger set
of pages (e.g.
n=20 and n=30) and we found that the OSim score of
the two rankings increases, albeit slightly, as the size of
n grows.
For example in the topic Sports, the
OSim between DR and PR for
n=10 is 0.019, whereas for n=20 the OSim score is 0.023 and for 
n=30, OSim is 0.028. Our results show that even the pairs with the 
greatest similarity among all pairs examined (e.g. the rankings delivered
for the News topic), according to the
OSim measure, have
little in common. Despite the usefulness of the
OSim measure for
making rough estimations about the ability of the two ranking 
schemes in identifying the same top pages with respect to some 
topics, it cannot directly capture which ranking is more useful for 
ordering pages in Directory topics. This is because
OSim does not
indicate the degree to which the relative orderings of the top
n
pages of two rankings are in agreement. Having established that 
PageRank and DirectoryRank order Web pages substantially differ-ently
, we proceed to investigate which of these rankings is better for 
ordering Web pages in Directory topics. To that end, we carried out 
a user study, reported next.
4.3 DirectoryRank Performance
To determine which of the two ranking measures, namely
DR and
PR, is perceived as more useful by Web users for organizing pages 
in Web Directories, we carried out a user study. From our sample 
data, we picked the top 10 pages listed in 7 randomly selected topics
(out of the 156 topics examined) and we recruited 15 postgraduate
volunteers from our school. Table 4 lists the 7 topics selected. 
For each topic, the volunteer was shown 2 result rankings; one consisted
of the top 10 pages for the topic ranked with
DR, and the
other consisted of the top 10 pages for the topic ranked with
PR.
For each topic, the volunteer was asked to read the pages in both 
lists and indicate which of the two rankings, in their opinion, is 
more "useful" overall for communicating information about the 
topic. Volunteers were not told anything about how either of the 
rankings was generated. In order to avoid misinterpretations while 
analyzing the user's selection preferences, we asked from the users 
to indicate their descriptive selections directly. More specifically,
we presented to our participants the following choices and we asked 
them to indicate for which of the following reasons they selected 
one ranking over the other for each of the topics examined.

Reason R1. "I prefer this ranking because I obtained significant 
information about the topic from most of the pages". In our analysis
, we interpret the ranking preferences established on this reason 
as "topic-informative" rankings. 
Reason R2: "I prefer this ranking because I have seen most of the 
pages before and I liked them". We interpret the ranking preferences
established on this reason as "popular" rankings. 
We then compared the participants' descriptive selections for every 
topic with the final
DR/ PR choices. This way we ensure that users'
preferences would be accurately evaluated even if two volunteers 
had exactly the same descriptive selection, but they ended up casting
that selection into different
DR,  PR rankings. As a final note,
we also asked our volunteers to indicate their familiarity with the 
experimental topics, by characterizing as "familiar" or "unfamiliar" 
each of the topics examined. In our evaluation, we considered that 
one ranking was better than the other if at least 50% of the users 
selected it as more "useful". Table 5 shows the rankings selected by 
our subjects as more useful for each of the 7 examined topics. Every 
row corresponds to a separate user. The columns marked as T
i
show
what the preference of the user was for the particular topic. Under 
the T
i
columns the keyword
DR means that the user considered
DirectoryRank as more useful for that topic, while PR means that 
the user deemed PageRank as more useful. The column marked as 
R on the right of a T
i
column indicates the reason for which the user
voted over the specified ranking. Table 6 summarizes the rankings 
preferred by the majority of the users for each of the topics.

Our survey results demonstrate that the majority of the users perceived
in overall DirectoryRank as more useful in comparison to 
PageRank for ordering Web pages in the Directory's topics. This is 
attested by the fact that for most of the topics examined (for 5 out of 
the 7 topics), the majority of our subjects preferred
DR over PR. A
closer look at the obtained results indicates that the reason on which
21
our participants' based most of their
DR selections, is Reason 1,
which implies that the rankings delivered by
DR are perceived as
more topic-informative. Conversely, most of the users who liked 
better the rankings induced by
PR, established their selection on
Reason 2. This suggests that the usefulness of
PR is not implied
mainly by how informative a page is about a topic, but rather that it 
is substantially influenced by the page's popularity.

Moreover, although not reported here due to space limit, our survey 
results show that our participants' answers were not generally influenced
by their familiarity or not with the underlying topics. This 
implies that our survey does not entail "topic-bias", since both 
rankings compared are applied to pages listed in the same topic.
RELATED WORK
There have been a number of studies trying to identify the best 
ranking order of the Web pages that are deemed to be relevant to a 
given query/topic. The most successful of these studies [8, 11] suggest
the exploitation of the pages' links connectivity on the Web 
graph for measuring the pages' importance and rank them accordingly
. The most widely known ranking metric that explores the 
pages' links structure for measuring their importance on the Web is 
PageRank. Currently, PageRank and its variations are used by most 
major Web Search Engines to rank the results that they return to 
Web users in response to their search requests. Despite PageRank's 
usefulness for ordering pages in the context of Search Engines, it is 
designed to measure the global importance of the pages on the 
Web, independent of any particular topics. However, the overall 
importance of the pages may be not a sufficient measure for ordering
the pages inside Directories' topics, essentially because pages 
that are important in some topics may not be important in others, 
regardless of the number and structure of the links that may appear 
in those pages. To alleviate some of the inherent limitations of PageRank
, a number of researchers designed new ranking metrics, 
which mainly rely on modifications of PageRank and are tailored 
for specific tasks. For example, [9] studies personalization of the 
PageRank metric by giving different weights to pages, [14] examine 
the local and the inter-site link structure in order to compute a 
global PageRank for Web pages, [7] introduce Hilltop, an algorithm 
which generates query-specific authority scores for improving rankings
for popular queries. While most of these works mainly focus 
on improving the rankings delivered to Web users by measuring the 
Web pages' overall importance, in this paper we are more concerned
about the topic importance of Web pages by measuring the 
pages' informativeness with respect to particular topics. In this 
scope, we perceive our work to be complementary to previous studies
on personalized rankings [9]. Moreover, there exists prior work 
that explores the lexical chaining technique as a means for representing
documents' contents [6, 12]. Recently, we employed the 
lexical chaining technique for the automatic classification of Web 
documents in topic hierarchies [13]. Our findings indicated the 
potential of lexical chains in successfully capturing the thematic
content of Web pages. This motivated our work to use the lexical 
chains generated for a number of Web pages as a means for ordering
pages within Directory topics. In the future we plan to investigate
how our approach could benefit from other linguistic approaches
, besides lexical chains.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we introduced DirectoryRank, a practical metric for 
determining how informative Web pages are for particular topics 
and ranking them accordingly. To evaluate the potential of DirectoryRank
in ordering Web pages inside Directory topics, we conducted
an experiment where we applied our DirectoryRank metric 
to order a set of pages listed within 156 topics in Google Directory 
and we compared the rankings induced by DirectoryRank to the 
rankings that PageRank delivers in Google Directory for the same 
set of pages and topics. In our study, we relied on the judgments 
made by 15 users to determine which ranking is perceived as more 
useful for Web Directories' users. Obtained results indicate that in 
overall users preferred DirectoryRank over PageRank for ordering 
Web pages inside the Directory's topics. Although it would probably
require additional studies in order to evaluate the applicability 
of our method to Web Directories other than Google and assess 
DirectoryRank's usefulness to a larger user and categories base, we 
believe that our work can serve as the first step towards a topic-informative
ranking metric within directories.
