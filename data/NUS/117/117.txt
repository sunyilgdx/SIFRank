Interestingness of Frequent Itemsets Using Bayesian Networks as Background Knowledge
ABSTRACT
The paper presents a method for pruning frequent itemsets
based on background knowledge represented by a Bayesian
network. The interestingness of an itemset is defined as the
absolute difference between its support estimated from data
and from the Bayesian network. Efficient algorithms are presented
for finding interestingness of a collection of frequent
itemsets, and for finding all attribute sets with a given minimum
interestingness. Practical usefulness of the algorithms
and their efficiency have been verified experimentally.

INTRODUCTION
Finding frequent itemsets and association rules in database
tables has been an active research area in recent years.
Unfortunately, the practical usefulness of the approach is
limited by huge number of patterns usually discovered. For
larger databases many thousands of association rules may
be produced when minimum support is low. This creates
a secondary data mining problem: after mining the data,
we are now compelled to mine the discovered patterns. The
problem has been addressed in literature mainly in the context
of association rules, where the two main approaches are

sorting rules based on some interestingness measure, and
pruning aiming at removing redundant rules.
Full review of such methods is beyond the scope of this
paper. Overviews of interestingness measures can be found
for example in [3, 13, 11, 32], some of the papers on rule
pruning are [30, 31, 7, 14, 28, 16, 17, 33].
Many interestingness measures are based on the divergence
between true probability distributions and distributions
obtained under the independence assumption. Pruning
methods are usually based on comparing the confidence
of a rule to the confidence of rules related to it.
The main drawback of those methods is that they tend
to generate rules that are either obvious or have already
been known by the user. This is to be expected, since the
most striking patterns which those methods select can also
easily be discovered using traditional methods or are known
directly from experience.
We believe that the proper way to address the problem
is to include users background knowledge in the process.
The patterns which diverge the most from that background
knowledge are deemed most interesting. Discovered patterns
can later be applied to improve the background knowledge
itself.
Many approaches to using background knowledge in machine
learning are focused on using background knowledge
to speed up the hypothesis discovery process and not on discovering
interesting patterns. Those methods often assume
strict logical relationships, not probabilistic ones. Examples
are knowledge based neural networks (KBANNs) and uses
of background knowledge in Inductive Logic Programming.
See Chapter 12 in [20] for an overview of those methods and
a list of further references.
Tuzhilin et. al. [23, 22, 29] worked on applying background
knowledge to finding interesting rules. In [29, 22] interestingness
measures are presented, which take into account
prior beliefs; in another paper [23], the authors present an
algorithm for selecting a minimum set of interesting rules
given background knowledge. The methods used in those
papers are local, that is, they don't use a full joint probability
of the data. Instead, interestingness of a rule is evaluated
using rules in the background knowledge with the same consequent
. If no such knowledge is present for a given rule, the
rule is considered uninteresting. This makes it impossible to
take into account transitivity. Indeed, in the presence of the
background knowledge represented by the rules A  B and
178
Research Track Paper
B  C, the rule A  C is uninteresting. However, this cannot
be discovered locally. See [25] for a detailed discussion
of advantages of global versus local methods. Some more
comparisons can be found in [18].
In this paper we present a method of finding interesting
patterns using background knowledge represented by a
Bayesian network. The main advantage of Bayesian networks
is that they concisely represent full joint probability
distributions, and allow for practically feasible probabilistic
inference from those distributions [25, 15]. Other advantages
include the ability to represent causal relationships, easy to
understand graphical structure, as well as wide availability
of modelling tools. Bayesian networks are also easy to modify
by adding or deleting edges.
We opt to compute interestingness of frequent itemsets
instead of association rules, agreeing with [7] that directions
of dependence should be decided by the user based on her
experience and not suggested by interestingness measures.
Our approach works by estimating supports of itemsets from
Bayesian networks and comparing thus estimated supports
with the data. Itemsets with strongly diverging supports
are considered interesting.
Further definitions of interestingness exploiting Bayesian
network's structure are presented, as well as efficient methods
for computing interestingness of large numbers of itemsets
and for finding all attribute sets with given minimum
interestingness.
There are some analogies between mining emerging patterns
[6] and our approach, the main differences being that
in our case a Bayesian network is used instead of a second
dataset, and that we use a different measure for comparing
supports. Due to those differences our problem requires a
different approach and a different set of algorithms.
DEFINITIONS AND NOTATION
Database attributes will be denoted with uppercase letters
A, B, C, . . ., domain of an attribute A will be denoted
by Dom(A). In this paper we are only concerned with categorical
attributes, that is attributes with finite domains.
Sets of attributes will be denoted with uppercase letters
I, J, . . .. We often use database notation for representing
sets of attributes, i.e. I = A
1

instead of the set theoretical
notation {A

).
Values from domains of attributes and attribute sets are denoted
with corresponding lowercase boldface letters, e.g. i 
Dom(I).
Let P
I
denote a joint probability distribution of the attribute
set I. Similarly let P
I
|J
be a distribution of I conditioned
on J. When used in arithmetic operations such
distributions will be treated as functions of attributes in I
and I  J respectively, with values in the interval [0, 1]. For
example P
I
(i) denotes the probability that I = i.
Let P
I
be a probability distribution, and let J  I. Denote
by P

where the summation is over the domains of all variables
from I \ J.
Probability distributions estimated from data will be denoted
by adding a hat symbol, e.g. ^
P

.
An itemset is a pair (I, i), where I is an attribute set and
i  Dom(I). The support of an itemset (I, i) is defined as
supp(I, i) = ^
P
I
(i),
where the probability is estimated from some dataset. An
itemset is called frequent if its support is greater than or
equal to some user defined threshold minsupp. Finding all
frequent itemsets in a given database table is a well known
datamining problem [1].
A Bayesian network BN over a set of attributes H =

INTERESTINGNESS OF AN ATTRIBUTE SET WITH RESPECT TO A BAYESIAN NETWORK
Let us first define the support of an itemset (I, i) in a
Bayesian network BN as
supp
BN
(I, i) = P
BN
I
(i).
Let BN be a Bayesian network over an attribute set H,
and let (I, i) be an itemset such that I  H. The interestingness
of the itemset (I, i) with respect to BN is defined
as
I
BN
(I, i) = |supp(I, i) - supp
BN
(I, i)|
that is, the absolute difference between the support of the
itemset estimated from data, and the estimate of this support
made from the Bayesian network BN . In the remaining
part of the paper we assume that interestingness is always
computed with respect to a Bayesian network BN and the
subscript is omitted.
An itemset is -interesting if its interestingness is greater
than or equal to some user specified threshold .
A frequent interesting itemset represents a frequently occurring
(due to minimum support requirement) pattern in
the database whose probability is significantly different from
what it is believed to be based on the Bayesian network
model.
An alternative would be to use supp(I, i)/supp
BN
(I, i)
as the measure of interestingness [6]. We decided to use
absolute difference instead of a quotient since we found it to
be more robust, especially when both supports are small.
One could think of applying our approach to association
rules with the difference in confidences as a measure of interestingness
but, as mentioned in the Introduction, we think
179
Research Track Paper
that patterns which do not suggest a direction of influence
are more appropriate.
Since in Bayesian networks dependencies are modelled using
attributes not itemsets, it will often be easier to talk
about interesting attribute sets, especially when the discovered
interesting patterns are to be used to update the background
knowledge.
Definition
3.1. Let I be an attribute set. The interestingness
of I is defined as
I(I) =
max
iDom(I)
I(I, i),
(2)
analogously, I is -interesting if I(I)  .
An alternative approach would be to use generalizations
of Bayesian networks allowing dependencies to vary for different
values of attributes, see [27], and deal with itemset
interestingness directly.
3.1
Extensions to the Definition of Interestingness
Even though applying the above definition and sorting
attribute sets on their interestingness works well in practice,
there might still be a large number of patterns retained,
especially if the background knowledge is not well developed
and large number of attribute sets have high interestingness
values. This motivates the following two definitions.
Definition
3.2. An attribute set I is hierarchically interesting
if it is -interesting and none of its proper subsets
is -interesting.
The idea is to prevent large attribute sets from becoming
interesting when the true cause of them being interesting
lies in their subsets.
There is also another problem with Definition 3.1. Consider
a Bayesian network
A  B
where nodes A and B have respective probability distributions
P
A
and P
B
|A
attached. Suppose also that A is interesting
. In this case even if P
B
|A
is the same as ^
P
B
|A
,
attribute sets B and AB may be considered -interesting.
Below we present a definition of interestingness aiming at
preventing such situations.
A vertex V is an ancestor of a vertex W in a directed graph
G if there is a directed path from V to W in G. The set of
ancestors of a vertex V in a graph G is denoted by anc(V ).
Moreover, let us denote by anc(I) the set of all ancestor
attributes in BN of an attribute set I. More formally:
anc
(I) = {A
i
/
I : V
A
i
anc(V
A
j
) in BN, for some A
j
I}.
Definition
3.3. An attribute set I is topologically
-interesting if it is -interesting, and there is no attribute
set J such that
1. J  anc(I)  I, and
2. I  J, and
3. J is -interesting.
The intention here is to prevent interesting attribute sets
from causing all their successors in the Bayesian network
(and the supersets of their successors) to become interesting
in a cascading fashion.
To see why condition 2 is necessary consider a Bayesian
network
A  X  B
Suppose that there is a dependency between A and B in data
which makes AB -interesting. Now however ABX may
also become interesting, (even if P
A
|X
and P
B
|X
are correct
in the network) and cause AB to be pruned. Condition 2
prevents AB from being pruned and ABX from becoming
interesting.
Notice that topological interestingness is stricter than hierarchical
interestingness. Indeed if J  I is -interesting,
then it satisfies all the above conditions, and makes I not
topologically -interesting.
ALGORITHMS FOR FINDING INTERESTING ITEMSETS AND ATTRIBUTE SETS
In this section we present algorithms using the definition
of interestingness introduced in the previous section to select
interesting itemsets or attribute sets. We begin by describing
a procedure for computing marginal distributions for a
large collection of attribute sets from a Bayesian network.
4.1
Computing a Large Number of Marginal
Distributions from a Bayesian Network
Computing the interestingness of a large number of frequent
itemsets requires the computation of a large number of
marginal distributions from a Bayesian network. The problem
has been addressed in literature mainly in the context
of finding marginals for every attribute [25, 15], while here
we have to find marginals for multiple, overlapping sets of
attributes. The approach taken in this paper is outlined
below.
The problem of computing marginal distributions from a
Bayesian network is known to be NP-hard, nevertheless in
most cases the network structure can be exploited to speed
up the computations.
Here we use exact methods for computing the marginals.
Approximate methods like Gibbs sampling are an interesting
topic for future work.
Best known approaches to exact marginalizations are join
trees [12] and bucket elimination [5]. We chose bucket elimination
method which is easier to implement and according
to [5] as efficient as join tree based methods. Also, join
trees are mainly useful for computing marginals for single
attributes, and not for sets of attributes.
The bucket elimination method, which is based on the distributive
law, proceeds by first choosing a variable ordering
and then applying distributive law repeatedly to simplify the
summation. For example suppose that a joint distribution
of a Bayesian network over H = ABC is expressed as
P
BN
ABC
= P
A
· P
B
|A
· P
C
|A
,
and we want to find P
BN
A
. We need to compute the sum

P

which can be rewritten as
P

· 0
@ X
b
Dom(B)
P
B
|A
1
A · 0@ X
c
Dom(C)
P
C
|A

A.
Assuming that domains of all attributes have size 3, computing
the first sum directly requires 12 additions and 18
multiplications, while the second sum requires only 4 additions
and 6 multiplications.
The expression is interpreted as a tree of buckets, each
bucket is either a single probability distribution, or a sum
over a single attribute taken over a product of its child buckets
in the tree. In the example above a special root bucket
without summation could be introduced for completeness.
In most cases the method significantly reduces the time
complexity of the problem. An important problem is choosing
the right variable ordering. Unfortunately that problem
is itself NP-hard. We thus adopt a heuristic which orders
variables according to the decreasing number of factors in
the product depending on each variable. A detailed discussion
of the method can be found in [5].
Although bucket elimination can be used to obtain supports
of itemsets directly (i.e. P
I
(i)), we use it to obtain
complete marginal distributions. This way we can directly
apply marginalization to obtain distributions for subsets of
I (see below).
Since bucket elimination is performed repeatedly we use
memoization to speed it up, as suggested in [21]. We remember
each partial sum and reuse it if possible. In the
example above
P
b
Dom(B)
P
B
|A
,
P
c
Dom(C)
P
C
|A
, and the
computed P
BN
A
would have been remembered.
Another method of obtaining a marginal distribution P
I
is marginalizing it from P
J
where I  J using Equation (1),
provided that P
J
is already known. If |J \ I| is small, this
procedure is almost always more efficient than bucket elimination
, so whenever some P
I
is computed by bucket elimination
, distributions of all subsets of I are computed using
Equation (1).
Definition
4.1. Let C be a collection of attribute sets.
The positive border of C [19], denoted by Bd
+
(C), is the
collection of those sets from C which have no proper superset
in C:
Bd
+
(C) = {I  C : there is no J  C such that I  J}.
It is clear from the discussion above that we only need to
use bucket elimination to compute distributions of itemsets
in the positive border. We are going to go further than this;
we will use bucket elimination to obtain supersets of sets
in the positive border, and then use Equation (1) to obtain
marginals even for sets in the positive border. Experiments
show that this approach can give substantial savings, especially
when many overlapping attribute sets from the positive
border can be covered by a single set only slightly larger
then the covered ones.
The algorithm for selecting the marginal distribution to
compute is motivated by the algorithm from [9] for computing
views that should be materialized for OLAP query
processing. Bucket elimination corresponds to creating a
materialized view, and marginalizing thus obtained distribution
to answering OLAP queries.
We first need to define costs of marginalization and bucket
elimination. In our case the cost is defined as the total
number of additions and multiplications used to compute
the marginal distribution.
The cost of marginalizing P
J
from P
I
, J  I using Equation
(1) is
cost(P
J
I
) = | Dom(J)| · (| Dom(I \ J)| - 1) .
It follows from the fact that each value of P
J
I
requires
adding | Dom(I \ J)| values from P
I
.
The cost of bucket elimination can be computed cheaply
without actually executing the procedure. Each bucket is
either an explicitly given probability distribution, or computes
a sum over a single variable of a product of functions
(computed in buckets contained in it) explicitly represented
as multidimensional tables, see [5] for details. If the bucket
is an explicitly given probability distribution, the cost is of
course 0.
Consider now a bucket b containing child buckets b
1
, . . . , b
n
yielding functions f
1
, . . . , f
n
respectively. Let Var(f
i
) the set
of attributes on which f
i
depends.
Let f = f
1
· f
2
· · · f
n
denote the product of all factors in
b. We have Var(f ) =
n
i
=1
Var(f
i
), and since each value
of f requires n - 1 multiplications, computing f requires
| Dom(Var(f ))| · (n - 1) multiplications. Let A
b
be the attribute
over which summation in b takes place. Computing
the sum will require | Dom(Var(f ) \ {A
b
})| · (| Dom(A
b
)| - 1)
additions.
So the total cost of computing the function in bucket b
(including costs of computing its children) is thus
cost(b)
=
n
X
i
=1
cost(b
i
) + | Dom(Var(f ))| · (n - 1)
+ | Dom(Var(f ) \ {A
b
})| · (| Dom(A
b
)| - 1).
The cost of computing P
BN
I
through bucket elimination,
denoted cost
BE
(P
BN
I
), is the cost of the root bucket of the
summation used to compute P
BN
I
.
Let C be a collection of attribute sets. The gain of using
bucket elimination to find P
BN
I
for some I while computing
interestingness of attribute sets from C can be expressed as:
gain(I) = -cost
BE
(P

An attribute set to which bucket elimination will be applied
is found using a greedy procedure by adding in each itera-tion
the attribute giving the highest increase of gain. The
complete algorithm is presented in Figure 1.

Finding All Attribute Sets With Given Minimum
Interestingness
In this section we will present an algorithm for finding all
attribute sets with interestingness greater than or equal to a
specified threshold given a dataset and a Bayesian network
BN .
Let us first make an observation:
Observation
4.2. If an itemset (I, i) has interestingness
greater than or equal to
with respect to a Bayesian network
BN then its support must be greater than or equal to
in
either the data or in BN . Moreover if an attribute set is
-interesting, by definition 3.1, at least one of its itemsets
must be -interesting.
It follows that if an attribute set is -interesting, then one
of its itemsets must be frequent, with minimum support ,
either in the data or in the Bayesian network.
Input: Bayesian network BN , minimum support minsupp.

6. remove itemsets with infrequent subsets from Cand
7. k  k + 1; goto 3
Figure 2: The AprioriBN algorithm
The algorithm works in two stages. First all frequent itemsets
with minimum support
are found in the dataset and
their interestingness is computed. The first stage might have
missed itemsets which are -interesting but don't have sufficient
support in the data.
In the second stage all itemsets frequent in the Bayesian
network are found, and their supports in the data are computed
using an extra database scan.
To find all itemsets frequent in the Bayesian network we
use the Apriori algorithm [1] with a modified support counting
part, which we call AprioriBN. The sketch of the algorithm
is shown in Figure 2, except for step 3 it is identical
to the original algorithm.
We now have all the elements needed to present the algorithm
for finding all -interesting attribute sets, which is
given in Figure 3.
Step 4 of the algorithm can reuse marginal distributions
found in step 3 to speed up the computations.
Notice that it is always possible to compute interestingness
of every itemset in step 6 since both supports of each
itemset will be computed either in steps 1 and 3, or in steps 4
and 5.
The authors implemented hierarchical and topological interestingness
as a postprocessing step. They could however
be used to prune the attribute sets which are not interesting
without evaluating their distributions, thus providing a
potentially large speedup in the computations. We plan to
investigate that in the future.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section we present experimental evaluation of the
method. One problem we were faced with was the lack
of publicly available datasets with nontrivial background
knowledge that could be represented as a Bayesian network
.
The UCI Machine Learning repository contains a
few datasets with background knowledge (Japanese credit,
molecular biology), but they are aimed primarily at Inductive
Logic Programming: the relationships are logical rather
than probabilistic, only relationships involving the class attribute
are included. These examples are of little value for
our approach.
We have thus used networks constructed using our own

data.
5.1
An Illustrative Example
We first present a simple example demonstrating the usefulness
of the method. We use the KSL dataset of Danish
70 year olds, distributed with the DEAL Bayesian network
package [4]. There are nine attributes, described in Table 1,
related to the person's general health and lifestyle. All continuous
attributes have been discretized into 3 levels using
the equal weight method.
FEV
Forced ejection volume of person's lungs
Kol
Cholesterol
Hyp
Hypertension (no/yes)
BMI
Body Mass Index
Smok
Smoking (no/yes)
Alc
Alcohol consumption (seldom/frequently)
Work
Working (yes/no)
Sex

Year
Survey year (1967/1984)
Table 1: Attributes of the KSL dataset.
We began by designing a network structure based on au-thors'
(non-expert) knowledge. The network structure is
given in Figure 4a. Since we were not sure about the relation
of cholesterol to other attributes, we left it unconnected.
Conditional probabilities were estimated directly from the
KSL
dataset. Note that this is a valid approach since even
when the conditional probabilities match the data perfectly
interesting patterns can still be found because the network
structure usually is not capable of representing the full joint
distribution of the data. The interesting patterns can then
be used to update the network's structure. Of course if both
the structure and the conditional probabilities are given by
a)
b)
Figure 4: Network structures for the KSL dataset
constructed by the authors
the expert, then the discovered patterns can be used to update
both the network's structure and conditional probabilities
.
We applied the algorithm for finding all interesting attribute
sets to the KSL dataset and the network, using the
threshold of 0.01. The attribute sets returned were sorted
by interestingness, and top 10 results were kept.
The two most interesting attribute sets were {F EV, Sex}
with interestingness 0.0812 and {Alc, Y ear} with interestingness
0.0810.
Indeed, it is known (see [8]) that women's lungs are on average
20% - 25% smaller than men's lungs, so sex influences
the forced ejection volume (FEV) much more than smoking
does (which we thought was the primary influence). This
fact, although not new in general, was overlooked by the
authors, and we suspect that, due to large amount of literature
on harmful effects of smoking, it might have been
overlooked by many domain experts. This proves the high
value of our approach for verification of Bayesian network
models.
The data itself implied a growth in alcohol consumption
between 1967 and 1984, which we considered to be a plausible
finding.
We then decided to modify the network structure based on
our findings by adding edges Sex  F EV and Y ear  Alc.
One could of course consider other methods of modifying
network structure, like deleting edges or reversing their direction
.
A brief overview of more advanced methods of
Bayesian network modification can be found in [15, Chap. 3,
Sect. 3.5]. Instead of adapting the network structure one
could keep the structure unchanged, and tune conditional
probabilities in the network instead, see [15, Chap. 3, Sect. 4]
for details.

Research Track Paper
As a method of scoring network structures we used the
natural logarithm of the probability of the structure conditioned
on the data, see [10, 26] for details on computing the
score.
The modified network structure had the score of -7162.71
which is better than that of the original network: -7356.68.
With the modified structure, the most interesting attribute
set was {Kol, Sex, Y ear} with interestingness 0.0665. We
found in the data that cholesterol levels decreased between
the two years in which the study was made, and that cholesterol
level depends on sex. We found similar trends in the
U.S. population based on data from American Heart Association
[2]. Adding edges Y ear  Kol and Sex  Kol
improved the network score to -7095.25.
{F EV, Alc, Y ear} became the most interesting attribute
set with the interestingness of 0.0286. Its interestingness is
however much lower than that of previous most interesting
attribute sets. Also, we were not able to get any improvement
in network score after adding edges related to that
attribute set.
Since we were unable to obtain a better network in this
case, we used topological pruning, expecting that some other
attribute sets might be the true cause of the observed discrepancies
. Only four attribute sets, given below, were topologically
0.01-interesting.
{Kol, BM I}
0.0144
{Kol, Alc}
0.0126
{Smok, Sex, Y ear}
0.0121
{Alc, W ork}
0.0110
We found all those patters intuitively valid, but were unable
to obtain an improvement in the network's score by
adding related edges. Moreover, the interestingness values
were quite small. We thus finished the interactive network
structure improvement process with the final result given in
Figure 4b.
The algorithm was implemented in Python and used on
a 1.7GHz Pentium 4 machine. The computation of interestingness
for this example took only a few seconds so an
interactive use of the program was possible. Further performance
evaluation is given below.
5.2
Performance Evaluation
We now present the performance evaluation of the algorithm
for finding all attribute sets with given minimum interestingness
. We used the UCI datasets and Bayesian networks
learned from data using B-Course [26]. The results
are given in Table 2.
The max. size column gives the maximum size of frequent
attribute sets considered. The #marginals column gives the
total number of marginal distributions computed from the
Bayesian network. The attribute sets whose marginal distributions
have been cached between the two stages of the
algorithm are not counted twice.
The time does not include the initial run of the Apriori algorithm
used to find frequent itemsets in the data (the time
of the AprioriBN algorithm is included though). The times
for larger networks can be substantial; however the proposed
method has still a huge advantage over manually evaluating
thousands of frequent patterns, and there are several possibilities
to speed up the algorithm not yet implemented by
the authors, discussed in the following section.

The maximum interestingness column gives the interestingness
of the most interesting attribute set found for a given
dataset. It can be seen that there are still highly interesting
patterns to be found after using classical Bayesian network
learning methods. This proves that frequent pattern and association
rule mining has the capability to discover patterns
which traditional methods might miss.
To give a better understanding of how the algorithm scales
as the problem size increases we present two additional figures
. Figure 5 shows how the computation time increases
with the number of marginal distributions that must be computed
from the Bayesian network. It was obtained by varying
the maximum size of attribute sets between 1 and 5.
The value of
= 0.067 was used (equivalent to one row in
the database). It can be seen that the computation time
grows slightly slower than the number of marginal distributions
. The reason for that is that the more marginal
distributions we need to compute, the more opportunities
we have to avoid using bucket elimination by using direct
marginalization from a superset instead.

size of the network is difficult, because the time depends
also on the network structure and the number of marginal
distributions computed (which in turn depends on the maximum
size of attribute sets considered).
We nevertheless show in Figure 6 the numbers of attributes
and computation times plotted against each other for some
of the datasets from Table 2. Data corresponding to maximum
attribute set sizes equal to 3 and 4 are plotted sepa-rately
.
It can be seen that the algorithm remains practically usable
for fairly large networks of up to 60 variables, even
though the computation time grows exponentially. For larger
networks approximate inference methods might be necessary
, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.
CONCLUSIONS AND DIRECTIONS OF FUTURE RESEARCH
A method of computing interestingness of itemsets and attribute
sets with respect to background knowledge encoded
as a Bayesian network was presented. We built efficient algorithms
for computing interestingness of frequent itemsets
and finding all attribute sets with given minimum interestingness
. Experimental evaluation proved the effectiveness
and practical usefulness of the algorithms for finding interesting
, unexpected patterns.
An obvious direction for future research is increasing efficiency
of the algorithms.
Partial solution would be to
rewrite the code in C, or to use some off-the-shelf highly op-timized
Bayesian network library like Intel's PNL. Another
approach would be to use approximate inference methods
like Gibbs sampling.
Adding or removing edges in a Bayesian network does not
always influence all of its marginal distributions. Interactiv-ity
of network building could be imporved by making use of
this property.
Usefulness of methods developed for mining emerging patterns
[6], especially using borders to represent collections of
itemsets, could also be investigated.
Another interesting direction (suggested by a reviewer)
could be to iteratively apply interesting patterns to modify
the network structure until no further improvement in the
network score can be achieved. A similar procedure has been
used in [24] for background knowledge represented by rules.
It should be noted however that it might be better to just
inform the user about interesting patterns and let him/her
use their experience to update the network. Manually up-dated
network might better reflect causal relationships between
attributes.
Another research area could be evaluating other probabilistic
models such as log-linear models and chain graphs
instead of Bayesian networks.
