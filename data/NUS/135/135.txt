Measuring Cohesion of Packages in Ada95
ABSTRACT
Ada95 is an object-oriented programming language. Pack-ages 
are basic program units in Ada 95 to support OO programming, 
which allow the specification of groups of logically related 
entities. Thus, the cohesion of a package is mainly about how 
tightly the entities are encapsulated in the package. This paper 
discusses the relationships among these entities based on 
dependence analysis and presents the properties to obtain these 
dependencies. Based on these, the paper proposes an approach to 
measure the package cohesion, which satisfies the properties that 
a good measure should have.

INTRODUCTION
Cohesion is one of the most important software features during its 
development. It tells us the tightness among the components of a 
software module. The higher the cohesion of a module, the more 
understandable, modifiable and maintainable the module is. A 
software system should have high cohesion and low coupling. 
Researchers have developed several guidelines to measure 
cohesion of a module [1, 3, 4]. Since more and more applications 
are object-oriented, the approaches to measure cohesion of object-oriented
(OO) programs have become an important research field.
Generally, each object-oriented programming language provides 
facilities to support OO features, such as data abstraction, 
encapsulation and inheritance. Each object consists of a set of 
attributes to represent the states of objects and a set of operations 
on attributes. Thus, in OO environment, the cohesion is mainly 
about how tightly the attributes and operations are encapsulated.
There are several approaches proposed in literature to measure 
OO program cohesion [2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12]. Most approaches are 
based on the interaction between operations and attributes. The 
cohesion is measured as the number of the interactions. Generally 
only the references from operations to attributes are considered. 
And few care about the interactions of attributes to attributes and 
operations to operations at the same time. This might lead to bias 
when measuring the cohesion of a class. For example, when 
designing the trigonometric function lib class, we might set a 
global variable to record the temporal result. The variable is 
referred in all the operations of the class. According to methods 
based on the interaction between operations and attributes [6, 7], 
the cohesion is the maximum 1. In fact, there are no relations 
among the operations if the calls are not taken into account. In 
this view, its cohesion is 0. The difference is caused by 
considering only the references from operations to attributes, 
while not considering the inter-operation relations.
In our previous work, we have done some research in measuring 
OO program cohesion [10, 13, 14]. Our approach overcomes the 
limitations of previous class cohesion measures, which consider 
only one or two of the three facets. Since the OO mechanisms in 
different programming languages are different from each other, 
this paper applies our measure to Ada packages.
The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2 
introduces the package in Ada 95. Section 3 discusses the basic 
definitions and properties for our measure. Based on the 
definitions and properties, Section 4 proposes approaches to 
measure package cohesion. Conclusion remarks are given in the 
last section.
PACKAGES IN ADA 95
In Ada 95[ISO95], packages and tagged types are basic program 
units to support OO programming. A package allows the 
specification of groups of logically related entities. Typically, a 
package contains the declaration of a type along with the 
declarations of primitive subprograms of the type, which can be 
called from outside the package, while its inner workings remain 
hidden from outside users. In this paper, we distinguish packages 
into four groups.
PG1: Packages that contain any kind of entities except
tagged types.
PG2: Packages that only contain the declaration of one
tagged type along with those primitive subprograms 
of the type. There are two subgroups in PG2:
- PG2-1: The type is an original tagged type. 
- PG2-2: The type is a derived type.

PG3: Combination of PG1 and PG2. 
 PG4: Generic packages.
After a generic package is instantiated, it belongs to one of the 
former three groups. Thus, only cohesion measure of PG1, PG2 
and PG3 is discussed in the paper.

DEFINITIONS
In this section, we will present our definitions in the form of PG1. 
The cohesion of a package from PG1 is mainly about how tightly 
the objects and subprograms are encapsulated in the package. In 
this paper, the relationships among objects and subprograms are 
defined as three dependencies: inter-object, inter-subprogram and 
subprogram-object dependence.
Definition 1 In the package body or a subprogram of the package, 
if the definition (modification) of object A uses (refer, but not 
modify) object B directly or indirectly, or whether A can been 
defined is determined by the state of B, then A depends on B, 
denoted by A B.
Generally, if B is used in the condition part of a control statement 
(such as if and while), and the definition of A is in the inner 
statement of the control statement, the definition of A depends on 
B's state.
Definition 2 If object A is referred in subprogram P, P depends 
on A, denoted by P A.
Definition  3 There are two types of dependencies between 
subprograms: call dependence and potential dependence. If P is 
called in M, then M call depends on P, denoted by M P. If the 
object A used in M is defined in P, the A used in M depends on 
the A defined in P, denoted by M



A
A,
P, where (A, A) is
named as a tag. For each call edge, add a tag (*, *) for unification. 
i.e. if P Q, P


*,*
Q.
To obtain these dependencies, we introduce four sets for each 
subprogram M:
ท IN(M) is an object set, each element of which is an object
referred before modifying its value in M;
ท OUT(M) is an object set, each element of which is an
object modified in M.
ท DEP_A (M) is a dependence set which represents the
dependencies from the objects referred in M to the objects 
defined outside M. Each element has the form &lt;A, B&gt;, 
where A and B are objects of the package.
ท DEP_A_OUT(M) is a dependence set which records the
dependencies from the objects referred in M to the objects 
defined outside M when exiting M.
In general, the intermediate results are invisible outside, and an 
object might be modified many times in a subprogram. We 
introduce DEP_A_OUT to improve the precision. Obviously, 
DEP_A_OUT(M)
DEP_A (M).

In our previous work [8, 9], we have proposed methods to analyze 
dependencies among statements for Ada programs. And these 
dependencies can be easily transformed to the dependencies 
proposed in this paper. Due to the space limitation, we do not 
discuss them in detail here.
To present our cohesion measure in a united model, we introduce 
package dependence graph to describe all types of dependencies.
Definition 4 The package dependence graph (PGDG) of a 
package PG is a directed graph, PGDG = &lt;N, E, T&gt;, where N is 
the node set and E is the edge set, T is the tag set. N = N
O
N
P
,
N
O
is the object node set, each of which represents a unique
object; N
P
is the subprogram node set, each of which represents a
unique subprogram. PGDG consists of three sub-graphs:
ท Inter-Object Dependence Graph (OOG), OOG = &lt;N
O
, E
O
&gt;,
where N
O
is the object node set (the name of a node is the
name of the object it represents); E
O
is the edge set, if
A B, then edge &lt;A, B&gt;
E
O
.
ท Inter-Subprogram Dependence Graph (PPG), PPG = &lt;N
P
,
E
P
, T&gt;, where N
P
is the subprogram node set; E
P
is the
edge set which represents the dependencies between 
subprograms; T
(V ื V) is the tag set, where V is the
union of objects and {*}.
ท Subprogram-Object Dependence Graph (POG), POG = &lt;N,
E
PO
&gt;, where N is the node set which represents objects
and subprograms; E
PO
is the edge set representing
dependencies between subprograms and objects. If P A, 
&lt;P, A&gt;
E
PO.
Example1 shows the package Tri, which contains three objects: 
temp, temp1 and temp2, and four subprograms: sin, cos, tg and 
ctg. Figure 1 shows the PGDG of the package Tri in Example1 
(all the Tags on PPG are (*, *), because there are only call 
dependencies in this example. We omit the Tags for 
convenience).
Example1: package Tri.
package Tri is
temp, temp1, temp2: real;

function sin (x: real) return real;
function cos (x: real) return real;
function tg (x: real) return real;
function ctg (x: real) return real;
end Tri;

package body Tri is
function sin (x: real) return real is
begin temp:=...; return temp; end sin;
...
63
function tg (x: real) return real is
begin
temp1:=sin(x);temp2:=cos(x);
temp:=temp1/temp2; return temp;
end tg;
...
end Tri;












3.2 Extended Definitions
Since there is no object in the package of PG2, the definitions of 
Section 3 can not be applied to these packages directly. Therefore, 
this section will extend the definitions of Section 3.1 to a more 
general model by the following steps:
For PG1, if there is an embedded package, the package is
taken as an object.
For PG2, take the components of the type as objects of the
package.
Let A, B be object of a type T, M, P primitive subprograms, and 
Com1 and Com2 are components of T. Then
A, B (A.Com1   B.Com2)  Com1   Com2.
A, P (P   A.Com)  P   Com.

For PG3, take the types as objects of the package.
To present our measure in a unified model, we add powers

MEASURING PACKAGE COHESION
According to the PGDG, this section will propose our method to 
measure the package cohesion. In the following discussions, we 
assume package PG contains n objects and m subprograms, where 
m, n
0.
4.1  Measuring Inter-Object Cohesion
Inter-object cohesion is about the tightness among objects in a 
package. To measure this cohesion, for each object A, introduce a 
set A_DEP to record the objects on which A depends, i.e.
O_DEP(A) = {B| A B, A
B}.
Let

depends on other objects.
If  n=0, there is no object in the package, we set it to 0. If n=1, 
there is one and only one object in the package, the cohesion is its 
power.
4.2  Measuring Subprogram-Object Cohesion
Subprogram-object cohesion is the most important field in 
measuring cohesion. Until now, there have been several 
approaches proposed in literature, such as Chae's methods [6, 7]. 
But most approaches are based on the POG. As we have 
mentioned above, all these methods describe the object reference 
in a simple way and subprograms are connected by the objects 
referred. Whether there are related among these subprograms are 
not described exactly. Thus, these approaches should be improved 
to describe these relations. For completeness, we use Co(Prev) to 
represent a previous cohesion measure, which satisfies Briand's 
four properties.
For each subprogram P, we introduce another two sets: P_O and 
P_O_OUT. Where
ท P_O(P) records all the objects referred in P.

If the objects referred in P are not related to other subprograms, 
these objects can work as local variables. It decreases the 
cohesion to take a local variable for a subprogram as an object for 
all subprograms. If there is no object or subprogram in the 
package, no subprogram will depend on others. Thus,

4.3  Measuring Inter-Subprogram Cohesion
In the PGDG, although subprograms can be connected by objects, 
this is not necessary sure that these subprograms are related. To 
measure the inter-subprogram cohesion, we introduce another set 
P_DEP(P) = {M| P M} for each P. The inter-subprogram 
cohesion Cohesion(P_P, PG) is defined as following:

If each subprogram depends on all other subprograms, 
Cohesion(P_P, PG) = 1.
If all subprograms have no relations with any other subprogram, 
Cohesion(P_P, PG) = 0.
4.4  Measuring Package Cohesion
After measuring the three facets independently, we have a 
discrete view of the cohesion of a package. We have two ways to 
measure the package cohesion:
1)  Each measurement works as a field, the package
cohesion is 3-tuple,
Cohesion(PG) = &lt;  Cohesion(O_O, PG),
Cohesion(P_O, PG),  
 Cohesion(P_P, PG)&gt;.
2)  Integrate the three facets as a whole

Cohesion
3
(PG) = Cohesion(P_O, PG)
If n=0, m
0, the package cohesion describes only the tightness of
the call relations, thus we introduce a parameter k to constrain it.
For the example shown in Figure 1, the cohesion of Tri describes 
as follows:
Cohesion(O_O, Tri)= 1/3 
Cohesion(P_O, Tri)=0 
Cohesion(P_P, Tri)=1/3
Let k
1
= k
2
= k
3
= 1/3, Co(Prev)=1, then
Cohesion(Tri)= 2/9.
Briand  et al. [3, 4] have stated that a good cohesion measure 
should be
(1)  Non-negative and standardization.  
(2)  Minimum and maximum. 
(3) Monotony. 
(4) Cohesion does not increase when combining two
modules.
These properties give a guideline to develop a good cohesion 
measure.
According to the definitions, it is easy to prove our measure 
satisfies these properties.
4.5  Cohesion for PG2-2
In the hierarchies of types, the derived type inherits the 
components and primitive subprograms of the super types. 
Generally, inheritance will increase the coupling and decrease the
65
cohesion. For the package from PG2-2, we will discuss its 
cohesion in four cases:
Case 1: Take the package independently.
Case 2: Take all the primitive subprograms and components 
(contains those from super type) into consideration.
Case 3: If the primitive subprograms of the derived type might 
access the components (or subprogram) of the super type, take 
these components (or subprogram) as those of the derived type.
Case 4: Take the super type as an object of the derived type.  
The shortcoming of Case 1 is that: It only measures the cohesion 
of the additional components and primitive subprograms of the 
derived type, not the complete type.
The primitive subprograms in the super type can not access the 
components of the derived type except dispatched subprograms. 
Consequently, in Case 2 or 3, the deeper the hierarchy of types is, 
the smaller the cohesion. And it is hard to design a package which 
cohesion is big enough. 
Although we present four cases in this section, none is good 
enough to describe the cohesion for a package from PG2-2. To 
measure the cohesion of a derived type, much more aspects 
should be considered.
RELATED WORKS
There have several methods proposed in literatures to measure 
class cohesion. This section gives a brief review of these methods.
(1) Chidamber's LCOM1
[0,

)

(

], it measures the
cohesion by similar methods and non-similar methods. It is a 
reverse cohesion measure. The bigger the measure, the lower the 
cohesion.
(2)  The PPG in Hitz's  LCOM2  is represented by an undirected 
graph.  LCOM2 is the number of sub-graphs connected. When 
there is one and only one sub-graph, he introduces connectivity to 
distinguish them.
(3) Briand's RCI is the ratio of the number of edges on POG to 
the max interaction between subprograms and objects.
(4) Henderson's LCOM3 can be described as follows.

(5) Chae's CO [6] introduces glue methods, and Xu-Zhou's CO 
[13] introduces cut set (glue edges) to analyze the interact pattern. 
These two measures are more rational than other measures.
From the introductions above, we can see that
ท  All these methods consider the attribute reference in a
simple way. Whether the methods are related or not are 
not described exactly.
ท  LCOM1,  LCOM2 and LCOM3 are non-standard, because
their up-bounds are related to the number of methods in 
the class. LCOM1  is non-monotonous. The measuring 
results might be inconsistent with intuition in some cases
ท  RCI has the basic four properties proposed by Briand. But
it does not consider the patterns of the interactions among 
its members, neither LCOM1 and LCOM2 nor LCOM3.
ท  Chae's  CO overcomes most limitations of previous
measures. But it is non-monotonous [13]. Xu-Zhou's CO 
improves Chae's cohesion measure, and makes its result 
more consistent with intuition. The chief disadvantage of 
both measures is that they can be applied to connected 
POG; otherwise the result will always be 0.
ท  LCOM1 and LCOM2 measure the cohesion among
methods in a class. We can improve the similar function 
using the dependencies among methods proposed in this 
paper.
ท  LCOM3, Chae and Xu-Zhou's CO measure the cohesion
among methods and attributes in a class. In this paper we 
improve them by introducing

for each method M.
CONCLUSION
This paper proposes an approach to measure the cohesion of a 
package based on dependence analysis. In this method, we 
discussed the tightness of a package from the three facets: inter-object
, subprogram-object and inter-subprogram. These three 
facets can be used to measure the package cohesion independently 
and can also be integrated as a whole. Our approach overcomes 
the limitations of previous class cohesion measures, which 
consider only one or two of the three facets. Thus, our measure is 
more consistent with the intuition. In the future work, we will 
verify and improve our measure by experiment analysis
When measuring package cohesion, the following should be paid 
attentions.
(1)  In the hierarchies of types, the primitive subprograms of
super type might access the objects of the derived type by 
dispatching. Therefore, when measuring the cohesion of 
PG2, it is hard to determine whether the accession of 
derived typed is considered or not.
(2)  We can determine polymorphic calls in an application
system. However it is impossible for a package, which 
can be reused in many systems.
(3)  How to deal with some special subprograms, such as
access subprograms, since such subprograms can access 
some special objects in the package.
(4) How to apply the domain knowledge to cohesion
measure.
In all, if a package can be applied to many applications, the 
cohesion is mainly about itself without considering the 
application environments. Otherwise, it is the cohesion in the 
special environments.
