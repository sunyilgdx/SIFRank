What's There and What's Not? Focused Crawling for Missing Documents in Digital Libraries
ABSTRACT
Some large scale topical digital libraries, such as CiteSeer, harvest 
online academic documents by crawling open-access archives, 
university and author homepages, and authors' self-submissions. 
While these approaches have so far built reasonable size libraries, 
they can suffer from having only a portion of the documents from 
specific publishing venues. We propose to use alternative online 
resources and techniques that maximally exploit other resources to 
build the complete document collection of any given publication 
venue.
We investigate the feasibility of using publication metadata to 
guide the crawler towards authors' homepages to harvest what is 
missing from a digital library collection. We collect a real-world 
dataset from two Computer Science publishing venues, involving 
a total of 593 unique authors over a time frame of 1998 to 2004. 
We then identify the missing papers that are not indexed by 
CiteSeer. Using a fully automatic heuristic-based system that has 
the capability of locating authors' homepages and then using 
focused crawling to download the desired papers, we demonstrate 
that it is practical to harvest using a focused crawler academic 
papers that are missing from our digital library. Our harvester 
achieves a performance with an average recall level of 0.82 
overall and 0.75 for those missing documents. Evaluation of the 
crawler's performance based on the harvest rate shows definite 
advantages over other crawling approaches and consistently 
outperforms a defined baseline crawler on a number of measures.

INTRODUCTION
Digital libraries that are based on active crawling methods such as 
CiteSeer often have missing documents in collections of archived 
publications, such as ACM and IEEE. How do such digital 
libraries find and obtain those missing? We propose using 
external resources of publication metadata and focused crawlers 
to search the Web for those missing.
The basic concept of a focused crawler (also known as a topical 
crawlers) [1], is based on a crawling strategy that relevant Web 
pages contain more relevant links, and these relevant links should 
be explored first. Initially, the measure of relevancy was based on 
keywords matching; connectivity-based metrics were later 
introduced [2]. In [3] the concept of a focused crawler was 
formally introduced: a crawler that seeks, acquires, indexes, and 
maintains pages on a specific set of topics that represent a 
relatively narrow segment of the Web.
Today, focused crawling techniques have become more important 
for building specialty and niche (vertical) search engines While 
both the sheer volume of the Web and its highly dynamic content 
increasingly challenge the task of document collection, digital 
libraries based on crawling benefit from focused crawlers since 
they can quickly harvest a high-quality subset of the relevant 
online documents.
Current approaches to harvesting online academic documents 
normally consist of focused crawling of open-access archives, 
author and institution web sites and directories of authors' self-submissions
. A random sample of 150 journals and conferences in 
Computer Science show that less than 10% have websites that are 
open to crawlers. Many of the top publishing venues that have 
their documents electronically available to subscribers such as the 
ACM Digital Library, the IEEE Digital, Library or the Springer-Verlag
Digital Library, normally use access permission 
techniques and robots.txt to ban crawlers. A recent study indicates 
that CiteSeer indexes 425, 000 unique research documents related 
to Computer Science, DBLP contains 500,464 records and there 
are 141,345 records in the Association for Computing Machinery 
(ACM) Digital Library and 825,826 records in the more 
comprehensive ACM Guide [4]. The study also shows that in 
CiteSeer there is an overlapping portion of 86, 467 documents 
(20.2% of CiteSeer's total archive) comprising 17.3% of the 
Digital Bibliography & Library Project (DBLP) archive.
This research investigates alternative online resources and 
focused crawling techniques to build a complete document

collection for any given publication venue. We propose to answer 
the following:
Q1 - What are the best focused crawling techniques to maximally 
exploit online resources, in order to harvest the desired papers   
effectively and efficiently?
Q2 ­ Is it effective to use authors' homepages as alternative 
online resources to find the missing documents?
Q3 ­ How can the above methods be automated to effectively 
obtain missing documents?
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we 
present a review of related work. In Section 3 we cover in much 
detail the design rationale of the system. In Section 4 we describe 
how we collect data and perform the evaluation, and present the 
results with discussion. Finally, we conclude the paper with future 
work proposed in Section 5.
RELATED WORK
The focused crawling literature shows that much has been focused 
on enhancing the dynamic performance, scalability, effectiveness, 
and efficiency of the crawler, namely, harvesting higher-quality 
documents in a shorter period of time.
Breadth-first searching is probably the simplest strategy for 
crawling, i.e. traversing the Web in a way that a directed graph is 
traveled using a breadth-first search algorithm. Interestingly, a 
breadth-first crawler is found to be capable of yielding high-quality
documents at an early stage of the crawl [5]. Although 
more sophisticated crawlers tend to retrieve even higher quality 
pages than their breadth-first counterparts, they are usually 
computationally more expensive. In our study, we use a multi-threaded
breadth-first crawler as a baseline to compare to our own 
crawling method.
Best-first crawling attempts to direct the crawler towards the best 
(i.e. most relevant in terms of topic relevance) documents. 
Different heuristics, such as link-based criteria, lexical similarity 
measures, contextual knowledge, and fine-tuned combinations of 
such have been explored in a number of studies over the years. In 
[2], the authors find that PageRank [6] can yield the best 
performance when ordering seed URLs. However, a more recent 
study [7] shows that PageRank metrics may just be too general in 
context without regard to the specific target topic. An updated 
version of PageRank algorithm which reflects the importance with 
respect to a particular topic has been proposed [8].
In [3], a Bayesian classifier is used to estimate the probability that 
a page belongs to the target topic, in a way that a node belongs to 
a certain position in an existing taxonomy hierarchy. In [9], a 
keyword-based vector space model is used to calculate the 
similarity of Web pages to the seed URLs, and if the similarity is 
above a certain threshold, the pages are downloaded and indexed, 
and their out-going links are followed.
A focused crawler [10] based on context graphs is proposed by so 
that the crawler can extract information about the context within 
which desired documents are usually found.  A set of classifiers 
are then trained to classify in-degree Web pages according to an 
estimation of their relevance to the topic. The relevance 
estimation then navigates the crawler towards desired documents.
Crawlers with a probability model are used for calculating 
priorities, which combines Web page content-based learning, 
URL token-based learning, and link-based learning [11]. In a later 
work, [12] takes into account the users' access behavior and re-tunes
the previous model to connect this behavior with the 
predicate satisfaction probability of the candidate Web pages 
waiting to be crawled.
An interesting "reversed" approach is proposed in [13], which 
suggests a given scientific document from a digital library be used 
as an input to the focused crawler. The main title and reference 
titles of the document are extracted and used to train a classifier to 
learn topical knowledge. The crawler is then guided by such 
knowledge to discover other topic-relevant documents on the Web.
More up-to-date reviews of focused crawling algorithms are 
presented in [14] and [15]. In [14], five different methods are 
implemented and evaluated within a unified evaluation 
framework on small and large datasets.
Here we discuss two studies that bear similarities to ours. The 
HPSearch and Mops presented in [16] support the search for 
research papers close to the homepages of certain scientists. 
However, their system does not investigate the issues of document 
harvesting for digital libraries for different publishing venues. 
Furthermore, our system outperforms theirs in terms of the 
percentage of correct homepages returned. In a more recent study 
[17], a Paper Search Engine (PaSE) is proposed, which uses 
citation information to locate online copies of scientific 
documents. While their study addresses a different research 
question, the PaSE system employs similar heuristics as we do to 
favor certain out-going links in order to quickly locate academic 
papers.
SYSTEM DESIGN
We develop an automated system in which document metadata is 
used to automatically locate the homepages of the authors and 
focused crawl these homepages with the intent of finding missing 
documents. Our system, shown in Figure 1, consists of a 
Homepage Aggregator and a smart Focused Crawler.
The system accepts a user's request to harvest the desired papers 
published in a specific venue (e.g. a conference or a journal). The 
Homepage Aggregator will query a Public Metadata Repository 
and extract useful metadata heuristics to assist in quickly and 
accurately locating URLs of the authors' homepages. A list of 
such URLs will be inserted into the Homepage URL Database. 
The Crawler uses focused crawling techniques to search the 
domains for desired publications. It accepts the seed URLs as an 
input and uses them as starting points for the crawl. The Crawler 
uses anchor text to determine link priorities and quickly navigates 
through the websites using to get to the desired academic papers. 
The harvested documents will be stored in the Document 
Database.

3.2  Using Metadata to Locate Homepages
Crawling authors' homepages first requires the system to be able 
to locate such websites quickly and accurately. A study of the 
literature indicates that personal website and homepage finding 
have been studied a lot since the birth of WWW. In [18], the 
authors present AHOY! as the first working system for personal 
homepage finding, which can filter irrelevant pages based on 
pattern matching heuristics. Later, the TREC (Text REtrieval 
Conference) hosted the task of Web homepage finding in 2001 
and its subsequent years, and algorithms based on link analysis, 
linguistic cues, and machine learning etc. are proposed [19, 20, 
21]. Examples of current working systems include 
HomePageSearch (hpsearch.uni-trier.de) which is a Homepage 
Aggregator mainly for computer scientists, and compiled 
directories (e.g. Google Directory)
See Figure 2 for the architecture of the Homepage Aggregator 
component.

Figure 2. Architecture of the Homepage Aggregator
The goal of the Homepage Aggregator is to look for homepages 
of the authors and save them as seed URLs to feed the Focused 
Crawler. First it queries the Metadata Repository and retrieves the 
document metadata. For each author, it extracts from metadata a 
value pair of (N, P), where N is the name of the author and P is 
the name of the venue (with a number of variations) in which the 
paper is published. A list of such pairs is then submitted to a Web 
search engine. Pages returned by the search engine will go 
through a Homepage Filter where we use metadata heuristics to 
remove false positives (pages that are not likely to be the 
homepages of the authors) and disambiguate among namesakes, if 
there is any. Different priority weights are assigned to the 
remaining pages according to their likelihood of being the 
homepage of the author. The more likely it's the homepage of the
author, the higher priority it receives. Eventually the page with 
the highest priority weights will be inserted into the Homepage 
URL Database, and will be crawled later.
Recall that we extract from metadata a pair value of (N, P). Now 
let U be the URL and T be the title of a Web page P returned by 
the Web search engine. When there are more than two authors for 
the same paper, assume Ui are the URLs of the homepages of 
other authors already found by the system. We have incorporated 
the findings in [16] about major characteristics of personal 
homepages. The metadata heuristics employed in the Homepage 
Filter are explained in Table 1.

U receives high priority if T contains 
N and any of the following: 
homepage (home page), web

papers.

U receives medium priority if T 
contains any of the following: 
homepage (home page), web 
(website), research, publication, 
papers.

U receives low priority when neither 
one of the above two rules is fired.

3.3  Crawler Architecture
The Focused Crawler crawls web pages, using heuristics to 
quickly navigate to the publications. The architecture of the 
component is shown in Figure 3.
The crawler accepts two primary sets of inputs that vary for each 
crawl. The first is a set of seed URLs that are the starting points of 
the crawl. These are added to the crawl queue at low priority. The 
second set of inputs is a collection of domain names that the 
crawler is permitted to crawl.
Once the seed URLs are entered into the queue, the crawler 
threads are started. Each thread gets one URL from the priority 
queue, and downloads the page that it points to.
After a page is downloaded, the out-going links are examined and 
those matched with the ignored list are removed, either because 
they are out of the target domain or because their MIME types are 
not processed by the crawler. At this point, if a PDF/PostScript 
document is found, it will be inserted into the Document Database. 
The rest of the out-going links will each be classified as high, 
medium, or low priority, and inserted into different priority 
queues.

Figure 3. Architecture of the Focused Crawler
In order to concentrate or limit the crawls towards only desirable 
content, the crawler is provided with three lists for reference. The 
contents of the lists may be changed depending on the types of 
domains being crawled.  
The Ignore List is a set of file types that are to be ignored by the 
crawler. The most common types of URLs that are ignored by the 
crawler are links to image files. The list can also include parts of 
the domain(s) being crawled, which the crawler is not supposed to 
visit. Table 2 shows a sample Ignore List.
Table 2. Sample Ignore List
File Types
.jpg, .bmp, .gif, .png, .jpeg, .mpg, .mpeg, .avi
http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/picture.html

Domains
http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/courses.html
Files of type JPG, BMP etc will be ignored during the crawl. Also 
any outgoing links to pages within the ignored domains will not 
be considered for crawling. 
The Allow List on the other hand is a collection of domain names 
that make up the crawl space of the crawler. Links pointing 
outside the specified domains are ignored by the crawler (unless 
they are determined to be research documents). This list is useful 
to limit the breadth of the crawl to only those domains that are of 
interest. Table 3 shows a sample Allow List.
Table 3. Sample Allow List
Domains
http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu
So the link http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu will be considered for 
crawling if it's discovered. 
Priority lists contain a set of keywords and their assigned weights 
that are used to determine the priorities of the extracted links. The 
links will be visited by the crawler in the order of their assigned 
priority.  
The Crawl Queue holds the discovered URLs that are yet to be 
crawled. This queue consists of three sub-queues: High-priority, 
Medium-priority and Low-priority queue. The Low-priority queue 
is the default queue. The seed URLs are entered into this queue.
We adopt a simple yet very effective heuristics to make the 
priority classification based upon the likelihood of the link 
eventually leading to academic publications.
We first train a classifier with data collected from two publishing 
venues: the Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) Conference and the 
Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). Several crawls are carried 
out with a breadth-first policy. The logs of the crawls are 
analyzed and a traverse tree is generated for each of the crawl that 
indicates the URLs visited and the link path that is followed by 
the crawler to reach the desired publications.  
Consider a small website having 11 pages as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Sample Website
The circles represent URL's in the website and the arrows are the 
hyperlinks from one page to another. The link structure shown is 
that which is followed by the breadth-first crawler to visit each 
URL. All other links such as those that may point outside the 
domain are ignored in the above diagram. 
The node marked with `S' is the seed or start URL. The nodes 
marked with `P' are research document files that are detected by 
the crawler. Now the links that are of interest to us are S A P 
and S C D P. The anchor text contained in these links `SA', 
`AP', `SC', `SD', `DP' is extracted and marked as `interesting'. 
The text in the remainder of the links is also noted, but goes in 
`not interesting' set. 
Similar analysis is done on all the logs that are generated by the 
breadth-first crawl. All the keywords that are commonly 
occurring in the "interesting" class and not so commonly 
occurring in the "non-interesting" class are extracted. Weights are 
assigned to each of these keywords depending on their placement 
in the link structure. The keywords closer to the documents are 
given more weight that those closer to the seed URL. For e.g. 
keyword `SA' has a lesser weight than keyword `DP' as `DP' is 
closer to P than to S as opposed to `SA'. 
The formula for calculating keyword weight is:
W (OT
oq
) = D (Q) / D (P)

(I)
where OT
oq
is the anchor text of the out-going link from page O
to page Q; P is the desired academic paper found by following the 
link from O to Q;  D(P) denotes the distance (number of hops) 
between  P and the starting URL S on the path

and the starting URL S on the path S...OQ. 
Now that a list of anchor texts and their corresponding priority 
weights has been compiled during the training process, we can 
classify each of them into different priority categories according 
to the weights. Table 4 shows a few samples extracted from our 
list.
Table 4. Sample Anchor Texts
Priority Anchor

We now need to consider how to prioritize out-going links that 
are more likely to lead to desired academic publications. The 
anchor text in these links is compared against the weighted 
keywords. If any of the weighted keywords are present in the text, 
the comparison is considered to be successful. There are no 
keywords having more than one weight. The final priority of the 
link is calculated by the following function.
The priority of a link may also depend on the priority of its parent. 
This is mainly due to the fact that not all the links that emerge 
from a page with a medium or high priority may lead to a research 
document. For e.g. in Figure 4 the node `C' will be crawled with a 
medium priority, however only node `D' leads to a research 
document. The priority of the node `E' is thus reduced to low as it 
will not have a weighted keyword attached to it and that of `D' is 
increased to high. The priorities of links thus established are used 
to insert the link in the proper priority queue for crawling. In 
order to achieve high efficiency, the crawler spawns multiple 
threads which will be fed with URLs on the descending order of 
priority. When there is no URL left in the priority queues and no 
crawler thread is currently running, the crawling task is finished.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We have collected data from two Computer Science publication 
venues: the ACM SIGMOD International Workshop on the Web 
and Databases (WebDB), first held in 1998 and then each year in 
conjunction with the annual ACM SIGMOD Conference, and 
Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), which was 
established in 1993 both as an electronic scientific journals and a 
hard-copy semiyearly published by AAAI Press. We choose these 
two venues because both of them are highly selective venues with
less than a 25% acceptance rate and we want to observe if there is 
a major difference of performance between conferences and 
journals.
We have extracted the metadata of WebDB and JAIR from the 
DBLP repository. By analyzing these metadata, we successfully 
identify the 593 unique authors who have in total published 289 
papers in either one of these two venues during the period from 
1998 to 2004. Please see Table 5 for more details of the dataset.

In order to examine whether our approach is effective in 
recovering those missing documents from a digital library, we use 
the CiteSeer Scientific Digital Library as another data source. 
Cross-referencing the metadata of each of the two venues from 
DBLP, we successfully identified 30 out of 118 (25.42%) WebDB 
papers and 46 out of 171 (26.90%) JAIR papers that are not 
indexed by CiteSeer (see Figure 5 for details). This is done by 
exact title-matching between the records in the DBLP metadata 
repository and the CiteSeer document archive.

and the corresponding venue (with a number of variations) are 
submitted to Google API and the first 10 URLs returned are 
parsed automatically by the Homepage Filter component. Using 
the heuristics discussed in the previous section, we assign priority 
weights to each of the URLs. For each author, URLs with the 
highest priority weights are inserted into the URL Database and 
crawled by the Focused Crawler at a later stage.
We have manually examined the records in the URL Database in 
order to evaluate the effectiveness of the Homepage Aggregator. 
In total, homepages of 539 authors (90.89%) have been found. 
Details about the 54 authors whose homepages cannot be found 
by the system are shown in Table 6. Here we define Non-U.S. 
authors to be those whose affiliations are not currently in the 
States.

There are only 2 papers ([22], [23]) of which all the authors' 
homepages are not found by the system, which account for less 
than 1% of the 289 papers in our data set. In other words, 
although the system fails to locate the homepages of about 9% of 
the authors, it is not a major performance impact on the document 
recall and the crawler should still be able to find 99.31% of all the 
papers.
For the cases where the system fails to locate some of the 
homepages, we notice that most of the 19 U.S. authors whose 
homepages are not found were actually in their graduate programs 
when they co-authored the paper, and their Web presences seem 
to have disappeared after graduation. In addition, there's a 
significant difference between the numbers of U.S. and non-U.S. 
authors whose homepages cannot be found, with non-U.S. almost 
twice the number of U.S. authors. Since this is our initial attempt 
limited to only the domain of computer science, whether this 
difference holds true for other disciplines and the reason behind 
remain an open question.  Finally, there are several cases where 
the homepages of those with famous names actually show up 
instead of the desired authors. For example, a search via Google 
API for the first author in [24] returns the homepage of a comic 
artist. The top 5 websites for George Russell, the first author of 
[25], happen to belong to that of a famous Jazz musician. There 
are also a few cases where the search engine actually returns the 
homepage of the co-author instead of the author himself, because 
the author's name is listed on the co-author's page as a 
collaborator and the co-author's page receives a higher page 
ranking. All these indicate that the disambiguation capability 
needs to be improved.
4.1  Finding Desired Academic Publications
When the crawl is finished, we manually examine the 
downloaded PDF/PostScript documents in order to evaluate the 
performance of the crawler. In total, the crawler has acquired 236 
out of the 289 papers (81.66%) published in WebDB (100 out of 
118, 84.75%) and JAIR (136 out of 171, 79.53%) from 1998 to 
2004. For details of the results for each venue, please see Figure 6

Here we adopt one of the performance metrics, recall level, first 
proposed in [16] and used in [17]. Recall level is defined as:
(i) = | S(i)
T | / | T |
where  S(i) is the set of documents downloaded by the crawler 
during a crawl on the dataset of a calendar year i; T is the set of 
desired documents, which in this study are the papers published 
by a specific venue in the same calendar year. This measure 
represents the capability of the system to capture desired 
academic papers.
Overall, our system has achieved a recall level of 0.8475 for 
WebDB and 0.7953 for JAIR documents. See Figure 8 for more 
details.
It's interesting to note that while the recall level of WebDB is 
constantly increasing until reaching 1.0 in the last two years, the 
recall level of JAIR seems to fluctuate around 0.8 over the 7-years
period. We find that 29 out of the 35 (82.86%) JAIR papers 
not found by the system are actually downloadable via a link from 
the authors' homepages to the publisher's website. Yet we miss 
these papers simply because we limit our crawler not to go 
beyond the domain of authors' homepages. We believe that a 
more sophisticated domain restriction for the crawler can be 
easily employed in order to achieve an even higher recall level.

Figure 8. Overall Recall Level, 1998 - 2004
We calculate the recall level for the documents published in 
WebDB and JAIR yet missing from CiteSeer's collection (see 
Figure 9). In this case, S(i) is the set of missing documents 
downloaded by the crawler, and T is the set of the papers not 
indexed by CiteSeer and missing from the collection. On average, 
the recall level has achieved 0.78 for WebDB and 0.72 for JAIR. 
Especially WebDB's recall level is constantly increasing, 
reaching 1.0 for the last three years. This proves that it's practical 
to harvest the missing documents for a given publishing venue.

Figure 9. Recall Level for the Missing Documents
The trends shown in Figure 8 and 9 seem to indicate that a rising 
number of academic papers have been put online, especially in 
and after the year 2000. However, it's interesting to note that it 
seems conference/workshop authors favor putting their 
publications on their homepages, while journal authors don't. Due 
to the limited size of our sample, we feel this is an open question 
to be answered with more data across multiple venues.
4.2  Crawler Comparison: BF Crawler
In order to further evaluate the performance of our system, we 
also compare our work to other crawling approaches. First we 
crawled three conference websites using our system and a 
breadth-first (BF) crawler. Figures 10, 11 and 12 show the results 
of crawls on different conference websites. The BF crawls are 
shown by the dashed line while the results of the focused crawler 
are shown by the solid line on the figures. The horizontal axis 
indicates the number of pages crawled and the vertical axis
represents the number of research documents found by searching 
those pages. The number of documents found is a cumulative sum 
of all PDF, PS and GZ files found on those sites. Since they may 
contain duplicate files or the same content in different file types, 
the numbers shown do not indicate unique papers. The number of 
pages crawled does not include academic papers. The same crawl 
restrictions applied to both the crawlers.

Figure 10. ACL Conference Crawl
Figure 10 shows the crawls done on parts of the Association for 
Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference website. The total 
number of pages crawled on this site were less than 30. Both 
crawls overlap which indicates that there is virtually no difference 
between the document detection rate of the BF crawler and our 
focused crawler. For such a small website, both crawlers detect 
the same number of documents after crawling the same number of 
pages on the website.

Figure 11. TREC Conference Crawl
Figure 11 shows the crawls done on the Text Retrieval 
Conference (TREC) pages. Here the total of pages crawled is 
about 1000 (only first half of the crawl is shown in the graph). 
Both crawlers start detecting documents at the same rate. After 
detecting around 1393 documents (35 pages crawled) the 
document detection rate of the focused crawler becomes slightly 
better than the BF crawler. Although the difference is not very 
significant, the focused crawler does detect the research 
documents slightly earlier in the crawl as compared to the BF 
crawler. The BF crawler detects the same amount of documents 
(4800 documents) as the focused crawler but after crawling 20-30
307
pages more than the focused crawler. The total number of 
documents found by both the crawlers is around 6000.

Figure 12. VLDB Conference Crawl
The crawls performed on the Very Large Database (VLDB) 
conference pages as shown in Figure 12 indicate that the focused 
crawler detects the documents much earlier in the crawl. Here the 
total number of pages crawled is about 3500. Approximately 28% 
(1000 out of 3500) of the documents are located by both the 
crawlers after crawling around 8.5% (300 out of 3500) of the 
domain. At this point the focused crawler continues to locate 
more documents while the BF crawler does not uncover any new 
documents until 28% (1000 out of 3500) of the total crawl. 85% 
(3000 out of 3500) of the documents are located by the focused 
crawler after completing just 33% (1189 out of 3500) of the total 
crawl, while the breadth first crawler locates the same amount of 
documents after completing 50% (1781 out of 3500) of the total 
crawl. Towards the end of the crawl the breadth-first crawler 
detects more papers as compared to the focused crawler. It takes 
the focused crawler around 1000 more pages of crawls until it 
makes up the difference. This seems to be due to the lack of 
keywords associated with the links that eventually led to the 
documents. The focused crawler evaluates other papers that have 
a higher priority values before eventually discovering the 
remaining documents. 
The behavior of the BF crawler is consistent for all the three 
crawls. Most of the documents located were in crawl depths 2, 3, 
4 and 5. The BF crawler detects them after completing search of 
the previous crawl depths.  As the focused crawler prioritizes the 
links for crawling, the higher depths with more priority are 
crawled before the lower depths with less priority. 
The above experiment indicates that the document harvest rate is 
almost the same for smaller websites. The difference becomes 
apparent when the size of the website being crawled is large. The 
focused crawler is able to detect the documents much earlier in 
the crawl as compared to the BF crawler. Since the crawls are not 
terminated early for the focused crawler, the number of 
documents found and the relevance of documents are same for 
both the crawlers. Therefore as the size of websites being crawled 
increases, the focused crawler detects more documents earlier 
during the crawls as compared to the BF crawler.  
We assess the crawler's capability of harvesting academic 
publications in a more general sense which is not only limited to a
specific venue. We have manually examined the first 500 
PDF/PostScript documents found by the two crawlers, classified 
the documents into academic publications which are desirable 
(papers published in conferences and journals; technical reports; 
degree thesis, etc.), and non-publication documents which are 
considered  noise for a publication collection (course material; 
presentation slides; project schedule; etc.) Percentage of both 
categories is compared side-by-side and shown in Figure 13. Our 
crawler has outperformed the breadth-first counterpart by having 
much less of this noise.

4.3  Crawler Comparison: Nutch Crawler
We compare the performance of our system with Nutch 
(http://www.nutch.org/docs/en/), an open source Web crawler and 
search engine built upon Lucene. In our experiment, we run the 
Nutch crawler on the official websites of WebDB and JAIR, and 
identify those papers published between 1998 and 2004 from the 
downloaded documents. We then compare the number of papers 
harvested by Nutch and FC crawler (see Figure 14 for details). 
Results show that guided by certain heuristics, crawling authors' 
homepages can actually achieve almost the same recall level as 
crawling publishers' websites.

hand discovers most of the documents after crawling around 84% 
(22 out of 26) of the website.

Documents found during the ACL conference crawl are classified

(non-publication). Figure 16 shows the number of 
documents in each category. Note that determining documents' 
relevancy is an offline process. Here R indicates relevant and NR

Figure 16. Relevancy of the ACL Conference Crawl
Figure 16 indicates that all the documents (PDF and PS) found by 
both the crawlers are academic publications (thus NR = 0). 
However, the 184 documents Nutch failed to detect are 
determined to be all relevant research publications.
The same comparison is also conducted by crawling the official 
WebDB conference websites. Figure 17 shows that the Focused 
Crawler starts detecting desired documents at an earlier stage as 
compared to the Nutch crawler. Yet due to the small number of 
pages crawled, a rigorous comparison cannot be made in this case. 
Figure 18 shows that the focused crawler locates two more 
academic publications than the Nutch crawler, both of which are 
marked as relevant documents.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have shown the feasibility of using authors' homepages as 
alternative online resources to harvest the academic papers 
missing from a collection of digital libraries, as well as the 
techniques to maximize the crawler's performance in doing so. 
We have designed and implemented a heuristic-based system 
which utilizes document metadata to accurately locate authors'
homepages and performs a focused crawling to quickly navigate 
to the desired publications. Evaluation has been conducted using a 
large dataset collected from several publishing venues in the 
Computer Science domain, and detailed results are presented and 
discussed.

Figure 18. Relevancy of the WebDB Conference Crawl
For the academic venues investigated in this study, we are able to 
fill many of the missing documents in the CiteSeer digital library.
The designed focused crawling technique efficiently locates 
desired publications on authors' homepages as well as conference 
websites. The Homepage Aggregator detects homepages well and 
the Focused Crawler outperforms the baseline crawler in a 
number of measures.
Future work includes a more rigorous disambiguation scheme for 
the Homepage Aggregator and a more sophisticated weighting 
scheme for the Focused Crawler. In addition, we are now 
developing a training process for the crawler to learn the URL 
patterns of alternative resources other than author homepages, 
such as institutional archives. Also, the automation of the process 
cycle of crawling, log analysis, and heuristics generation can help 
search engine based digital libraries scale and significantly reduce 
costs. The actual URL of the web pages can also be used to assist 
in priority assignment instead of just using the anchor text of the 
link. A comparison of this approach to techniques other than a 
Breadth-first crawl is currently underway. Furthermore, we plan 
to evaluate the validity of this approach by expanding our 
experiment on to disciplines other than the Computer Science
309
domain. We believe our study and its consequents will shed lights 
on the question of finding missing papers for our digital library, 
or "what's there and what's not".
