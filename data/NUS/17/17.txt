A Pseudo Random Coordinated Scheduling Algorithm for Bluetooth Scatternets
ABSTRACT
The emergence of Bluetooth as a default radio interface allows
handheld devices to be rapidly interconnected into ad hoc networks.
Bluetooth allows large numbers of piconets to form a scatternet using
designated nodes that participate in multiple piconets. A unit
that participates in multiple piconets can serve as a bridge and forwards
traffic between neighbouring piconets. Since a Bluetooth
unit can transmit or receive in only one piconet at a time, a bridging
unit has to share its time among the different piconets. To schedule
communication with bridging nodes one must take into account
their availability in the different piconets, which represents a difficult
, scatternet wide coordination problem and can be an important
performance bottleneck in building scatternets. In this paper
we propose the Pseudo-Random Coordinated Scatternet Scheduling
(PCSS) algorithm to perform the scheduling of both intra and
inter-piconet communication. In this algorithm Bluetooth nodes
assign meeting points with their peers such that the sequence of
meeting points follows a pseudo random process that is different
for each pair of nodes. The uniqueness of the pseudo random sequence
guarantees that the meeting points with different peers of
the node will collide only occasionally. This removes the need
for explicit information exchange between peer devices, which is
a major advantage of the algorithm. The lack of explicit signaling
between Bluetooth nodes makes it easy to deploy the PCSS algorithm
in Bluetooth devices, while conformance to the current Bluetooth
specification is also maintained. To assess the performance of
the algorithm we define two reference case schedulers and perform
simulations in a number of scenarios where we compare the performance
of PCSS to the performance of the reference schedulers.
INTRODUCTION
Short range radio technologies enable users to rapidly interconnect
handheld electronic devices such as cellular phones, palm devices
or notebook computers. The emergence of Bluetooth [1] as default
radio interface in these devices provides an opportunity to turn
them from stand-alone tools into networked equipment. Building
Bluetooth ad hoc networks also represents, however, a number of
new challenges, partly stemming from the fact that Bluetooth was
originally developed for single hop wireless connections. In this
paper we study the scheduling problems of inter-piconet communication
and propose a lightweight scheduling algorithm that Bluetooth
nodes can employ to perform the scheduling of both intra and
inter-piconet communication.
Bluetooth is a short range radio technology operating in the unlicensed
ISM (Industrial-Scientific-Medical) band using a frequency
hopping scheme. Bluetooth (BT) units are organized into piconets.
There is one Bluetooth device in each piconet that acts as the master
, which can have any number of slaves out of which up to seven
can be active simultaneously. The communication within a piconet
is organized by the master which polls each slave according to some
polling scheme. A slave is only allowed to transmit in a slave-to
-master slot if it has been polled by the master in the previous
master-to-slave slot. In Section 3 we present a brief overview of
the Bluetooth technology.
A Bluetooth unit can participate in more than one piconet at any
time but it can be a master in only one piconet. A unit that participates
in multiple piconets can serve as a bridge thus allowing
the piconets to form a larger network. We define bridging degree
as the number of piconets a bridging node is member of. A set
of piconets that are all interconnected by such bridging units is referred
to as a scatternet network (Figure 1). Since a Bluetooth unit
can transmit or receive in only one piconet at a time, bridging units
must switch between piconets on a time division basis. Due to the
fact that different piconets are not synchronized in time a bridging
unit necessarily loses some time while switching from one piconet
to the other. Furthermore, the temporal unavailability of bridging
nodes in the different piconets makes it difficult to coordinate the
communication with them, which impacts throughput and can be
an important performance constraint in building scatternets.
There are two important phenomena that can reduce the efficiency
of the polling based communication in Bluetooth scatternets:
· slaves that have no data to transmit may be unnecessarily
polled, while other slaves with data to transmit may have to
wait to be polled; and
· at the time of an expected poll one of the nodes of a master-slave
node pair may not be present in the piconet (the slave

to poll is not polling).
The first problem applies to polling based schemes in general, while
the second one is specific to the Bluetooth environment. In order
to improve the efficiency of inter-piconet communication the
scheduling algorithm has to coordinate the presence of bridging
nodes in the different piconets such that the effect of the second
phenomenon be minimized.
However, the scheduling of inter-piconet communication expands
to a scatternet wide coordination problem. Each node that has more
than one Bluetooth links have to schedule the order in which it communicates
with its respective neighbours. A node with multiple
Bluetooth links can be either a piconet master or a bridging node or
both. The scheduling order of two nodes will mutually depend on
each other if they have a direct Bluetooth link in which case they
have to schedule the communication on their common link for the
same time slots. This necessitates some coordination between the
respective schedulers. For instance in Figure 1 the scheduling order
of node A and the scheduling order of its bridging neighbours, B,
C, D and E mutually depend on each other, while nodes D and E
further effects nodes F, G and H as well. Furthermore, the possible
loops in a scatternet (e.g., A-E-G-H-F-D) makes it even more
complicated to resolve scheduling conflicts.
In case of bursty traffic in the scatternet the scheduling problem
is further augmented by the need to adjust scheduling order in response
to dynamic variation of traffic intensity. In a bursty traffic
environment it is desirable that a node spends most of its time on
those links that have a backlogged burst of data.
One way to address the coordination problem of inter-piconet
scheduling is to explicitly allocate, in advance, time slots for communication
in each pair of nodes. Such a hard coordination approach
eliminates ambiguity with regards to a node's presence in
piconets, but it implies a complex, scatternet wide coordination
problem and requires explicit signaling between nodes of a scatternet
. In the case of bursty traffic, hard coordination schemes
generate a significant computation and signaling overhead as the
communication slots have to be reallocated in response to changes
in traffic intensity and each time when a new connection is established
or released.
In this paper we propose the Pseudo-Random Coordinated Scatternet
Scheduling algorithm which falls in the category of soft coordination
schemes. In soft coordination schemes nodes decide their
presence in piconets based on local information. By nature, soft coordination
schemes cannot guarantee conflict-free participation of
bridging nodes in the different piconets, however, they have a significantly
reduced complexity. In the PCSS algorithm coordination
is achieved by implicit rules in the communication without the need
of exchanging explicit control information. The low complexity of
the algorithm and its conformance to the current Bluetooth specification
allow easy implementation and deployment.
The first key component of the algorithm is the notion of checkpoints
which are defined in relation to each pair of nodes that
are connected by a Bluetooth link and which represent predictable
points in time when packet transmission can be initiated on the particular
link. In other words, checkpoints serve as regular meeting
points for neighboring nodes when they can exchange packets. In
order to avoid systematic collision of checkpoints on different links
of a node the position of checkpoints follows a pseudo random sequence
that is specific to the particular link the checkpoints belong
to.
The second key component of the algorithm is the dynamic adjustment
of checking intensity, which is necessary in order to effec-tively
support bursty data traffic. Bandwidth can be allocated and
deallocated to a particular link by increasing and decreasing checkpoint
intensity, respectively.
To assess the performance of the algorithm we define two reference
schedulers and relate the performance of the PCSS scheme to these
reference algorithms in a number of simulation scenarios.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we
give an overview of related work focusing on Bluetooth scheduling
related studies available in the literature. Section 3 gives a brief
overview of the Bluetooth technology. In Section 4 and 5 we introduce
the proposed algorithm. In Section 6 we define the reference
schedulers. Finally, in Section 7 we present simulation results.
RELATED WORK
A number of researchers have addressed the issue of scheduling in
Bluetooth. Most of these studies have been restricted, however, to
the single piconet environment, where the fundamental question is
the polling discipline used by the piconet master to poll its slaves.
These algorithms are often referred to as intra-piconet scheduling
schemes. In [7] the authors assume a simple round robin polling
scheme and investigate queueing delays in master and slave units
depending on the length of the Bluetooth packets used. In [5] Johansson
et al. analyze and compare the behavior of three different
polling algorithms. They conclude that the simple round robin
scheme may perform poorly in Bluetooth systems and they propose
a scheme called Fair Exhaustive Polling. The authors demonstrate
the strength of this scheme and argue in favor of using multi-slot
packets. Similar conclusions are drawn by Kalia et al. who argue
that the traditional round robin scheme may result in waste and un-fairness
[8]. The authors propose two new scheduling disciplines
that utilize information about the status of master and slave queues.
In [9, 10] the authors concentrate on scheduling policies designed
with the aim of low power consumption. A number of scheduling
policies are proposed which exploit either the park or sniff low
power modes of Bluetooth.

Although the above studies have revealed a number of important
performance aspects of scheduling in Bluetooth piconets, the algorithms
developed therein are not applicable for inter-piconet communication
. In [6] the authors have shown that constructing an optimal
link schedule that maximizes total throughput in a Bluetooth
scatternet is an NP hard problem even if scheduling is performed
by a central entity. The authors also propose a scheduling algorithm
referred to as Distributed Scatternet Scheduling Algorithm
(DSSA), which falls in the category of distributed, hard coordination
schemes. Although the DSSA algorithm provides a solution
for scheduling communication in a scatternet, some of its idealized
properties (e.g., nodes are aware of the traffic requirements of their
neighbours) and its relatively high complexity make it difficult to
apply it in a real life environment.
There is an ongoing work in the Personal Area Networking (PAN)
working group of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) [2] to
define an appropriate scheduling algorithm for Bluetooth scatternets
BLUETOOTH BACKGROUND
Bluetooth is a short range radio technology that uses frequency
hopping scheme, where hopping is performed on 79 RF channels
spaced 1 MHz apart. Communication in Bluetooth is always between
master and slave nodes. Being a master or a slave is only
a logical state: any Bluetooth unit can be a master or a slave.
The Bluetooth system provides full-duplex transmission based on
slotted Time Division Duplex (TDD) scheme, where each slot is
0.625 ms long. Master-to-slave transmission always starts in an
even-numbered time slot, while slave-to-master transmission always
starts in an odd-numbered time slot. A pair of master-to-slave
and slave-to-master slots are often referred to as a frame. The communication
within a piconet is organized by the master which polls
each slave according to some polling scheme. A slave is only allowed
to transmit in a slave-to-master slot if it has been polled by
the master in the previous master-to-slave slot. The master may
or may not include data in the packet used to poll a slave. Bluetooth
packets can carry synchronous data (e.g., real-time traffic) on
Synchronous Connection Oriented (SCO) links or asynchronous
data (e.g., elastic data traffic, which is the case in our study) on
Asynchronous Connectionless (ACL) links. Bluetooth packets on
an ACL link can be 1, 3 or 5 slot long and they can carry different
amount of user data depending on whether the payload is FEC
coded or not. Accordingly, the Bluetooth packet types DH1, DH3
and DH5 denote 1, 3 and 5 slot packets, respectively, where the
payload is not FEC encoded, while in case of packet types DM1,
DM3 and DM5 the payload is protected with FEC encoding. There
are two other types of packets, the POLL and NULL packets that do
not carry user data. The POLL packet is used by the master when
it has no user data to the slave but it still wants to poll it. Similarly,
the NULL packet is used by the slave to respond to the master if it
has no user data. For further information regarding the Bluetooth
technology the reader is referred to [1, 3].
OVERVIEW OF THE PCSS ALGORITHM
Coordination in the PCSS algorithm is achieved by the unique
pseudo random sequence of checkpoints that is specific to each
master-slave node pair and by implicit information exchange between
peer devices. A checkpoint is a designated Bluetooth frame.
The activity of being present at a checkpoint is referred to as to
check. A master node actively checks its slave by sending a packet
to the slave at the corresponding checkpoint and waiting for a response
from the slave. The slave node passively checks its master
by listening to the master at the checkpoint and sending a response
packet in case of being addressed.
The expected behaviour of nodes is that they show up at each
checkpoint on all of their links and check their peers for available
user data. The exchange of user data packets started at a checkpoint
can be continued in the slots following the checkpoint. A
node remains active on the current link until there is user data in
either the master-to-slave or slave-to-master directions or until it
has to leave for a next checkpoint on one of its other links. In
the PCSS scheme we exploit the concept of randomness in assigning
the position of checkpoints, which excludes the possibility that
checkpoints on different links of a node will collide systematically,
thus giving the node an equal chance to visit all of its checkpoints.
The pseudo random procedure is similar to the one used to derive
the pseudo random frequency hopping sequence. In particular, the
PCSS scheme assigns the positions of checkpoints on a given link
following a pseudo random sequence that is generated based on the
Bluetooth clock of the master and the MAC address of the slave.
This scheme guarantees that the same pseudo random sequence
will be generated by both nodes of a master-slave pair, while the sequences
belonging to different node pairs will be different. Figure
2 shows an example for the pseudo random arrangement of checkpoints
in case of a node pair A and B. The length of the current base
checking interval is denoted by
T
(i)
check
and the current checking intensity
is defined accordingly as
1
T

. There is one checkpoint
within each base checking interval and the position of the checkpoint
within this window is changing from one time window to the
other in a pseudo random manner.

Figure 2: Pseudo-random positioning of checkpoints
Since the pseudo random sequence is different from one link to another
, checkpoints on different links of a node will collide only occasionally
. In case of collision the node can attend only one of the
colliding checkpoints, which implies that the corresponding neighbours
have to be prepared for a non-present peer. That is, the master
might not poll and the slave might not listen at a checkpoint.
We note that a collision occurs either if there are more than one
checkpoints scheduled for the same time slot or if the checkpoints
are so close to each other that a packet transmission started at the
first checkpoint necessarily overlaps the second one. Furthermore,
if the colliding checkpoints belong to links in different piconets,
the necessary time to perform the switch must be also taken into
account.
During the communication there is the possibility to increase or
decrease the intensity of checkpoints depending on the amount of
user data to be transmitted and on the available capacity of the
node. According to the PCSS algorithm a node performs certain
traffic measurements at the checkpoints and increases or decreases
the current checking intensity based on these measurements. Since
195
nodes decide independently about the current checking intensity
without explicit coordination, two nodes on a given link may select
different base checking periods. In order to ensure that two nodes
with different checking intensities on the same link can still communicate
we require the pseudo random generation of checkpoints
to be such that the set of checkpoint positions at a lower checking
intensity is a subset of checkpoint positions at any higher checking
intensities. In the Appendix we are going to present a pseudo random
scheme for generating the position of checkpoints, which has
the desired properties.
OPERATION OF PCSS
In what follows, we describe the procedures of the PCSS algorithm.
We start by the initialization process which ensures that two nodes
can start communication as soon as a new link has been established
or the connection has been reset. Next, we describe the rules that
define how nodes calculate their checkpoints, decide upon their
presence at checkpoints and exchange packets. Finally, we present
the way neighboring nodes can dynamically increase and decrease
of checkpoint intensity.
5.1
Initialization
In the PCSS algorithm there is no need for a separate initialization
procedure to start communication, since the pseudo random generation
of checkpoints is defined such that once a master slave node
pair share the same master's clock and slave's MAC address information
, it is guaranteed that the same pseudo random sequence will
be produced at each node. That is, it is guaranteed that two nodes
starting checkpoint generation at different time instants with different
checking intensities will be able to communicate. It is the own
decision of the nodes to select an appropriate initial checking intensity
, which may depend for example on the free capacities of the
node or on the amount of data to transmit. Once the communication
is established the increase and decrease procedures will adjust the
possibly different initial checking intensities to a common value.
5.2
Communication
A pair of nodes can start exchanging user data packets at a checkpoint
, which can expand through the slots following the checkpoint.
The nodes remain active on the current link following a checkpoint
until there is user data to be transmitted or one of them has to
leave in order to attend a checkpoint on one of its other links. After
a POLL/NULL packet pair has been exchanged indicating that
there is no more user data left the nodes switch off their transmit-ters/receivers
and remain idle until a next checkpoint comes on one
of their links. However, during the communication any of the nodes
can leave in order to attend a coming checkpoint on one of its other
links. After one of the nodes has left the remaining peer will realize
the absence of the node and will go idle until the time of its next
checkpoint. If the master has left earlier the slave will realize the
absence of the master at the next master-to-slave slot by not receiving
the expected poll. In the worst case the master has left before
receiving the last packet response from the slave, which can be a 5
slot packet in which case the slave wastes 5+1 slots before realizing
the absence of the master. Similarly, if the master does not get
a response from the slave it assumes that the slave has already left
the checkpoint and goes idle until its next checkpoint. Note that the
master may also waste 5+1 slots in the worst case before realizing
the absence of the slave.
A node stores the current length of the base checking interval and
the time of the next checkpoint for each of its Bluetooth links separately
. For its
i
th
link a node maintains the variable
T
(i)
check
to
store the length of the current base checking period in number of
frames and the variable
t
(i)
check
, which stores the Bluetooth clock
of the master at the next checkpoint. After passing a checkpoint
the variable
t
(i)
check
is updated to the next checkpoint by running
the pseudo random generator (
P seudoChkGen) with the current
value of the master's clock

The procedure
P seudoChkGen is described in the Appendix.
There is a maximum and minimum checking interval
T
max
=
2
f

and
T

f

, respectively. The length of the checking
period must be a power of 2 number of frames and it must take
a value from the interval
[2

, 2
f

].
5.3
Increasing and Decreasing Checking Intensity
The increase and decrease procedures are used to adjust the checking
intensity of a node according to the traffic intensity and to the
availability of the peer device. Each node decides independently
about the current checking intensity based on traffic measurements
at checkpoints.
Since the time spent by a node on a link is proportional to the ratio
of the number of checkpoints on that link and the number of checkpoints
on all links of the node, the bandwidth allocated to a link can
be controlled by the intensity of checkpoints on that link. This can
be shown by the following simple calculation.
Let us assume that the node has
L number of links and assume
further that for the base checking periods on all links of the node
it holds that
T

T
(i)
check
T

average number of checkpoints within an interval of length

is

A node has to measure the utilization of checkpoints on each of
its links separately in order to provide input to the checking intensity
increase and decrease procedures. According to the algorithm
a given checkpoint is considered to be utilized if both nodes have
shown up at the checkpoint and at least one Bluetooth packet carrying
user data has been transmitted or received. If there has not been
a successful poll at the checkpoint due to the unavailability of any
of the nodes or if there has been only a POLL/NULL packet pair
exchange but no user data has been transmitted, the checkpoint is
considered to be unutilized. We note that due to packet losses the
utilization of a given checkpoint might be interpreted differently by
the nodes. However, this does not impact correct operation of the
algorithm.
196
To measure the utilization of checkpoints

(i)
on the
i
th
link of the
node we employ the moving average method as follows. The utilization
of a checkpoint equals to 1 if it has been utilized, otherwise
it equals to 0. If the checkpoint has been utilized the variable

(i)
is updated as,

(i)
= q
uti
·
(i)
+ (1 - q
uti
) · 1;
if the checkpoint has not been utilized it is updated as,

(i)
= q
uti
·
(i)
+ (1 - q
uti
) · 0,
where
0  q
uti
&lt; 1 is the time scale parameter of the moving
average method. A further parameter of the utilization measurement
is the minimum number of samples that have to be observed
before the measured utilization value is considered to be confident
and can be used as input to decide about increase and decrease of
checking intensity. This minimum number of samples is a denoted
by
N
sample,min
.
Finally, a node also has to measure its total utilization, which is
defined as the fraction of time slots where the node has been active
(transmitted or received) over the total number of time slots. To
measure the total utilization of a node we employ the moving average
method again. Each node measures its own utilization

(node)
and updates the

(node)
variable after each
N
uti,win
number of
slots as follows:

(node)
= q
(node)
uti
·
(node)
+ (1 - q
(node)
uti
) ·
(win)
,
where

(win)
is the fraction of time slots in the past time window
of length
N
uti,win
where the node has been active over the total
number of time slots
N
uti,win
.
If the utilization of checkpoints on link
i falls below the lower
threshold

lower
, the current base checking period
T
(i)
check
will be
doubled. Having a low checkpoint utilization can be either because
one or both of the nodes have not shown up at all of the checkpoints
or because there is not enough user data to be transmitted. In either
cases the intensity of checkpoints has to be decreased. Whenever a
decrease or increase is performed on link
i the measured utilization

(i)
must be reset.
Since the parameter
T
(i)
check
is one of the inputs to the pseudo random
checkpoint generation process,
P seudoChkGen the checkpoints
after the decrease will be generated according to the new
period. Furthermore, due to the special characteristic of the checkpoint
generation scheme the remaining checkpoints after the decrease
will be a subset of the original checkpoints, which guarantees
that the two nodes can sustain communication independent of
local changes in checking intensities.
An example for the checking intensity decrease in case of a node
pair A and B is shown in Figure 3. First, node A decreases checking
intensity by doubling its current base checking period in response
to the measured low utilization. As a consequence node B
will find node A on average only at every second checkpoint and
its measured utilization will decrease rapidly. When the measured
utilization at node B falls below the threshold

lower
, B realizes
that its peer has a lower checking intensity and follows the decrease
by doubling its current base checking period. Although we
have not explicitly indicated in the Figure, it is assumed that there
has been user data exchanged at each checkpoint where both nodes
were present.

Recall from the utilization measurement procedure that there is a
minimum number of checkpoints

that has to be sam-pled
before the measured utilization is considered to be confident
and can be used to decide about checking intensity decrease. The
parameter
N

together with the parameter of the moving
average method

determine the time scale over which the
utilization of checkpoints has to be above the threshold

otherwise the node decreases checking intensity. It might be also
reasonable to allow that the parameter

and the moving
average parameter
q

can be changed after each decrease or
increase taking into account for example the current checking intensity
, the available resources of the node or the amount of user
data to be transmitted, etc. However, in the current implementation
we apply fixed parameter values.
After a checkpoint where user data has been exchanged (not only a
POLL/NULL packet pair) checking intensity can be increased provided
that the measured utilization of checkpoints exceeds the upper
threshold

upper
and the node has available capacity. Formally
a checking intensity increase is performed on link

two conditions are satisfied:

(i)
&gt;
upper
and

(node)
&lt;
(node)
upper
,
where

(node)
upper
is the upper threshold of the total utilization of the
node. This last condition ensures that the intensity of checkpoints
will not increase unbounded. The intensity of checkpoints is doubled
at each increase by dividing the current length of the base

REFERENCE ALGORITHMS
In this section we define the Ideal Coordinated Scatternet Scheduler
(ICSS) and the Uncoordinated Greedy Scatternet Scheduler
(UGSS) reference algorithms.
The ICSS algorithm represents
the "ideal" case where nodes exploit all extra information when
scheduling packet transmissions, which would not be available in a
realistic scenario. The UGSS algorithm represents the greedy case
where nodes continuously switch among their Bluetooth links in a
random order.
6.1
The ICSS Algorithm
The ICSS algorithm is a hypothetical, ideal scheduling algorithm
that we use as a reference case in the evaluation of the PCSS
scheme. In the ICSS algorithm a node has the following extra
information about its neighbours, which represents the idealized
property of the algorithm:
· a node is aware of the already pre-scheduled transmissions
of its neighbours; and
· a node is aware of the content of the transmission buffers of
its neighbours.
According to the ICSS algorithm each node maintains a scheduling
list, which contains the already pre-scheduled tasks of the node. A
task always corresponds to one packet pair exchange with a given
peer of the node. Knowing the scheduling list of the neighbours
allows the node to schedule communication with its neighbours
without overlapping their other communication, such that the capacity
of the nodes is utilized as much as possible. Furthermore
being aware of the content of the transmission buffers of neighbours
eliminates the inefficiencies of the polling based scheme,
since there will be no unnecessary polls and the system will be
work-conserving.
In the scheduling list of a node there is at most one packet pair
exchange scheduled in relation to each of its peers, provided that
there is a Bluetooth packet carrying user data either in the transmission
buffer of the node or in the transmission buffer of the peer
or in both. After completing a packet exchange on a given link the
two nodes schedule the next packet exchange, provided that there
is user data to be transmitted in at least one of the directions. If
there is user data in only one of the directions, a POLL or NULL
packet is assumed for the reverse direction depending on whether
it is the master-to-slave or slave-to-master direction, respectively.
The new task is fitted into the scheduling lists of the nodes using
a first fit strategy. According to this strategy the task is fitted into
the first time interval that is available in both of the scheduling lists
and that is long enough to accommodate the new task. Note that the
algorithm strives for maximal utilization of node capacity by trying
to fill in the unused gaps in the scheduling lists.
If there is no more user data to be transmitted on a previously busy
link, the link goes to idle in which case no tasks corresponding to
the given link will be scheduled until there is user data again in at
least one of the directions.
An example for the scheduling lists of a node pair A and B is shown
in Figure 5. The tasks are labeled with the name of the corresponding
peers the different tasks belong to. Each node has as many
pre-scheduled tasks in its scheduling list as the number of its active
Bluetooth links. A link is considered to be active if there is
schedule the next packet pair

6.2
The UGSS Algorithm
In the UGSS algorithm Bluetooth nodes do not attempt to coordinate
their meeting points, instead each node visits its neighbours
in a random order. Nodes switch continuously among their Bluetooth
links in a greedy manner. If the node has
n number of links it
chooses each of them with a probability of
1/n. The greedy nature
of the algorithm results in high power consumption of Bluetooth
devices.
If the node is the master on the visited link it polls the slave by
sending a packet on the given link. The type of Bluetooth packet
sent can be a 1, 3 or 5 slot packet carrying useful data or an empty
POLL packet depending on whether there is user data to be transmitted
or not. After the packet has been sent the master remains
active on the link in order to receive any response from the slave.
If the slave has not been active on the given link at the time when
the master has sent the packet it could not have received the packet
and consequently it will not send a response to the master. After
the master has received the response of the slave or if it has sensed
the link to be idle indicating that no response from the salve can be
expected, it selects the next link to visit randomly.
Similar procedure is followed when the node is the slave on the
visited link. The slave tunes its receiver to the master and listens
for a packet transmission from the master in the current master-to
-slave slot. If the slave has not been addressed by the master
in the actual master-to-slave slot it immediately goes to the next
link. However, if the slave has been addressed it remains active on
the current link and receives the packet. After having received the
packet of the master the slave responds with its own packet in the
following slave-to-master slot. After the slave has sent its response
it selects the next link to visit randomly.
SIMULATION RESULTS
First, we evaluate the algorithm in a realistic usage scenario, which
is the Network Access Point (NAP) scenario. Next we investigate
theoretical configurations and obtain asymptotical results that reveals
the scaling properties of the algorithm. For instance we investigate
the carried traffic in function of the number of forwarding
198
hops along the path and in function of bridging degree. Both in the
realistic and theoretical configurations we relate the performance of
the PCSS scheme to the performance of the ICSS and UGSS reference
algorithms. Before presenting the scenarios and simulation
results we shortly describe the simulation environment and define
the performance metrics that are going to be measured during the
simulations.
7.1
Simulation Environment
We have developed a Bluetooth packet level simulator, which is
based on the Plasma simulation environment [4]. The simulator
has a detailed model of all the packet transmission, reception procedures
in the Bluetooth Baseband including packet buffering, upper
layer packet segmentation/reassemble, the ARQ mechanism,
etc. The simulator supports all Bluetooth packet types and follows
the same master-slave slot structure as in Bluetooth. For the physical
layer we employ a simplified analytical model that captures the
frequency collision effect of interfering piconets.
In the current simulations the connection establishment procedures,
e.g., the inquiry and page procedures are not simulated in detail and
we do not consider dynamic scatternet formation either. Instead we
perform simulations in static scatternet configurations where the
scatternet topology is kept constant during one particular run of
simulation.
In the current simulations we run IP directly on top of the Bluetooth
link layer and we apply AODV as the routing protocol in the
IP layer. The simulator also includes various implementations of
the TCP protocol (we employed RenoPlus) and supports different
TCP/IP applications, from which we used TCP bulk data transfer
in the current simulations.
One of the most important user perceived performance measures is
the achieved throughput. We are going to investigate the throughput
in case of bulk TCP data transfer and in case of Constant Bit Rate
(CBR) sources.
In order to take into account the power consumption of nodes we
define activity ratio of a node,
r
act
as the fraction of time when
the node has been active over the total elapsed time; and power
efficiency,
p
ef f
as the fraction of the number of user bytes success-fully
communicated (transmitted and received) over the total time
the node has been active. The power efficiency shows the number
of user bytes that can be communicated by the node during an
active period of length 1 sec. Power efficiency can be measured
in [kbit/sec], or assuming that being active for 1 sec consumes 1
unit of energy we can get a more straightforward dimension of
[kbit/energy unit], which is interpreted as the number of bits that
can be transmitted while consuming one unit of energy.
7.2
Network Access Point Scenario
In this scenario we have a NAP that is assumed to be connected to
a wired network infrastructure and it provides network access via
its Bluetooth radio interface. The NAP acts as a master and up to 7
laptops, all acting as slaves, can connect to the NAP. Furthermore
we assume that each laptop has a Bluetooth enabled mouse and
each laptop connects to its mouse by forming a new piconet as it is
shown in Figure 6.
We simulate a bulk TCP data transfer from the NAP towards each
laptop separately. Regarding the traffic generated by the mouse we
assume that the mouse produces a 16 byte long packet each 50 ms,
NAP

max 7

Figure 6: Network Access Point Scenario
periodically. In the NAP-laptop communication we are interested
in the achieved throughput while in the laptop-mouse communication
we are concerned with the delay perceived by the mouse.
In the current scenario we switched off the dynamic checkperiod
adjustment capability of the PCSS algorithm and we set the base
checking period to 32 frames (40 ms), which is in accordance with
the delay requirement of a mouse. Note that this same base checking
period is applied also on the NAP-laptop links, although, there
is no delay requirement for the TCP traffic. However, the current
implementation in the simulator does not yet support the setting of
the base checking periods for each link separately. The dynamic
checking period adjustment would definitely improve the throughput
of NAP-laptop communication as we are going to see later in
case of other configurations.
The simulation results are shown in Figure 7. In plot (a) the averaged
throughput of NAP-laptop communications are shown in the
function of number of laptops for the different algorithms, respectively
. Graph (b) plots the sum of the throughputs between the
NAP and all laptops. As we expect, the individual laptop throughput
decreases as the number of laptops increases. However, it is
important to notice that the sum of laptop throughputs do not decrease
with increasing number of laptops in case of the PCSS and
ICSS algorithms. As the number of laptops increases the efficient
coordination becomes more important and the total carried traffic
will decrease with the uncoordinated UGSS scheme. The increase
of the total throughput in case of the PCSS algorithm is the consequence
of the fixed checking intensities, which allocates one half
of a laptop capacity to the mouse and the other half to the NAP. In
case of small number of laptops this prevents the laptops to fully
utilize the NAP capacity, which improves as the number of laptops
increases.
The
99% percentile of the delay seen by mouse packets is shown in
plot (c). The delay that can be provided with the PCSS algorithm
is determined by the base checking period that we use. Recall, that
in the current setup the base checking period of the PCSS scheme
was set to 32 frames, which implies that the delay has to be in the
order of 32 frames, as shown in the figure. The low delay with the
UGSS algorithm is due to the continuous switching among the links
of a node, which ensures high polling intensity within a piconet
and frequent switching between piconets. The UGSS algorithm
provides an unnecessarily low delay, which is less than the delay
requirement at the expense of higher power consumption.
Plots (d) and (e) show the averaged activity ratio over all laptops
and mice, respectively. The considerably higher throughput
achieved for small number of laptops by the ICSS scheme explains
its higher activity ratio. On graph (f) the averaged power efficiency
of laptops is shown, which relates the number of bytes transmitted
to the total time of activity. The power efficiency of the PCSS
199
scheme decreases with increasing number of laptops, which is a
consequence of the fixed checking intensities. Since the NAP has
to share its capacity among the laptops, with an increasing number
of laptops there will be an increasing number of checkpoints where
the NAP cannot show up. In such cases the dynamic checking intensity
adjustment procedure could help by decreasing checking
intensity on the NAP-laptop links. Recall that in the current scenario
we employed fixed checking intensities in order to satisfy the
mouse delay requirement. It is also important to notice that with the
uncoordinated UGSS scheme the activity ratio of a mouse is relatively
high, which is an important drawback considering the low
power capabilities of such devices.
7.3
Impact of Number of Forwarding Hops
In what follows, we investigate the performance impact of the number
of forwarding hops along the communication path in the scatternet
configuration shown in Figure 8. The configuration consists
of a chain of S/M forwarding nodes (
F
i
) and a certain number of
additional node pairs connected to each forwarding node in order to
generate background traffic. The number of S/M forwarding nodes
is denoted by
N
F
. There are
N
B
number of background node pairs
connected to each forwarding node as masters. The background
traffic flows from each source node
B
(S)
ij
to its destination pair
B
(D)
ij
through the corresponding forwarding node
F
i
. The traffic
that we are interested in is a bulk TCP data transfer between node
S and D. The background traffic is a CBR source, which generates
512 byte long IP packets with a period of length 0.05 sec.

Figure 8: Impact of number of forwarding nodes
During the simulations we vary the number of forwarding hops
N
F
and the number of background node pairs
N
B
connected to each
forwarding node. As one would expect, with increasing number of
forwarding hops and background node pairs the coordinated algorithms
will perform significantly better than the one without any
coordination (UGSS).
The throughput of the S-D traffic as a function of the number of
forwarding nodes (
N
F
) without background traffic (
N
B
= 0) and
with two pairs of background nodes (
N
B
= 2) are shown in Figure
9 (a) and (b), respectively. The throughput in case of no cross
traffic drops roughly by half when we introduce the first forwarding
node. Adding additional forwarding hops continuously reduces
the throughput, however, the decrease at each step is less drasti-cal
. We note that in case of the ICSS scheme one would expect
that for
N
F
&gt; 1 the throughput should not decrease by adding
additional forwarding hops. However, there are a number of other
effects besides the number of forwarding hops that decrease the
throughput. For instance, with an increasing number of forwarding
hops the number of piconets in the same area increases, which,
in turn, causes an increasing number of lost packets over the radio
interface due to frequency collisions. Furthermore with increasing
number of hops the end-to-end delay suffered by the TCP flow increases
, which makes the TCP connection less reactive to recover
from packet losses.
In the no background traffic case the PCSS scheme performs close
to the UGSS algorithm in terms of throughput. However, as we
introduce two pairs of background nodes the UGSS algorithm fails
completely, while the PCSS scheme still achieves approximately 20
kbit/sec throughput. Furthermore, the power efficiency of the PCSS
scheme is an order of magnitude higher than that of the UGSS algorithm
in both cases, which indicates that the PCSS algorithm consumes
significantly less power to transmit the same amount of data
than the UGSS scheme.
7.4
Impact of Bridging Degree
Next we investigate the performance of scheduling algorithms as
the number of piconets that a bridging node participates in is increased
. The scatternet setup that we consider is shown in Figure
10, where we are interested in the performance of the bridging node
C. Node C is an all slave bridging node and it is connected to master
nodes
P
i
, where the number of these master nodes is denoted
by
N
P
. To each master node
P
i
we connect
N
L
number of leaf
nodes as slaves in order to generate additional background load in
the piconets. We introduce bulk TCP data transfer from node C
towards each of its master node
P
i
and CBR background traffic
on each
L
ij
- P
i
link. The packet generation interval for background
sources was set to 0.25 sec, which corresponds to a 16
kbit/sec stream. During the simulation we vary the number of piconets
N
P
participated by node C and investigate the performance
of the PCSS algorithm with and without dynamic checkpoint intensity
changes. The number of background nodes
N
L
connected to
each master node
P
i
was set to
N
L
= 3 and it was kept constant in
the simulations.

both with fixed base checking periods equal to 32 frames ("PCSS-32"
) and with dynamic checking intensity changes as well ("PCSS-dyn"

Figure 9: Throughput and power efficiency in function of number of forwarding hops
It is important to notice that the per flow TCP throughputs in case
of the dynamic PCSS scheme matches quite closely the throughput
achieved by the ICSS algorithm and it significantly exceeds the
throughput that has been achieved by the fixed PCSS. This large
difference is due to the relatively low background traffic in the
neighbouring piconets of node
C, in which case the dynamic PCSS
automatically reduces checkpoint intensity on the lightly loaded
links and allocates more bandwidth to the highly loaded ones by
increasing checking intensity.
CONCLUSIONS
We have presented Pseudo Random Coordinated Scatternet
Scheduling, an algorithm that can efficiently control communication
in Bluetooth scatternets without exchange of control information
between Bluetooth devices. The algorithm relies on two key
components, namely the use of pseudo random sequences of meeting
points, that eliminate systematic collisions, and a set of rules
that govern the increase and decrease of meeting point intensity
without explicit coordination.
We have evaluated the performance of PCSS in a number of simulation
scenarios, where we have compared throughput and power
measures achieved by PCSS to those achieved by two reference
schedulers.
The first reference scheduler is an uncoordinated
greedy algorithm, while the other is a hypothetical "ideal" scheduler
.
In all the scenarios investigated we have found that PCSS achieves
higher throughput than the uncoordinated reference algorithm.
Moreover, with the traffic dependent meeting point intensity adjustments
the throughput and power measures of PCSS quite closely
match the results of the "ideal" reference algorithm. At the same
time PCSS consumes approximately the same amount of power as
the ideal scheduler to achieve the same throughput, which is significantly
less than the power consumption of the uncoordinated
reference scheduler.

APPENDIX
Here, we present the procedure for generating the pseudo random
sequence of checkpoints, where we reuse the elements of
the pseudo random frequency hop generation procedure available
in Bluetooth. The inputs to the checkpoint generation procedure
P seudoChkGen are the current checking period T
(i)
check
, the Bluetooth
MAC address of the slave
A
slave
and the current value of the
master's clock
t
(i)
. A node can perform checkpoint generation using
the
P seudoChkGen procedure at any point in time, it is always
guaranteed that the position of checkpoint generated by the
two nodes will be the same, as it has been pointed out in Section
5.1. Nevertheless the typical case will be that whenever a node arrives
to a checkpoint it generates the position of the next checkpoint
on the given link. The variable
t
(i)
check
always stores the master's
clock at the next checkpoint, thus it needs to be updated every time
a checkpoint is passed. Here we note that the Bluetooth clock of a
device is a 28 bit counter, where the LSB changes at every half slot.
Let us assume that the base period of checkpoints on the
i
th
link of
the node is
T
(i)
check
= 2
j-2
,
j &gt; 2 number of frames, which means
that there is one pseudo randomly positioned checkpoint in each
consecutive time interval of length
T
(i)
check
and the
j
th
bit of the
Bluetooth clock changes at every
T
(i)
check
. Upon arrival to a checkpoint
the variable
t
(i)
check
equals to the current value of the master's
clock on that link. After the checkpoint generation procedure has
been executed the variable
t
(i)
check
will store the master's clock at
the time of the next checkpoint on that link.
Before starting the procedure the variable
t
(i)
check
is set to the current
value of the master's clock
t
(i)
in order to cover the general
case when at the time of generating the next checkpoint the value
of
t
(i)
check
does not necessarily equals to the current value of the
master's clock
t
(i)
. The position of the next checkpoint is obtained
such that the node first adds the current value of
T
(i)
check
to the variable
t
(i)
check
, clears the bits
[j - 1, . . . , 0] of t
(i)
check
and
then generates the bits
[j - 1, . . . , 2] one by one using the procedure
P seudoBitGen(X, W
ctrl
). When generating the k
th
bit
(
j -1  k  2) the clock bits X = t
(i)
check
[k+1, . . . , k+5] are fed
as inputs to the
P seudoBitGen procedure, while the control word
W
ctrl
is derived from
t
(i)
check
including the bits already generated
and from the MAC address of the slave
A
slave
. The schematic view
of generating the clock bits of the next checkpoint is illustrated in
Figure 12.

Finally, we discuss the

in Figure 13.

Figure 13: The PseudoBitGen procedure
The
control
words
of
the
P seudoBitGen
procedure
W
ctrl
= {A, B, C, D} are the same as the control words of
the frequency hop selection scheme in Bluetooth and they are
shown in Table 2.
However, the input
X and the additional
bit selection operator at the end are different.
As it has been
discussed above the input
X is changing depending on which
bit of the checkpoint is going to be generated.
When generating
the
k
th
clock bit of the next checkpoint the clock bits
X = t
(i)
check
[k + 1, . . . , k + 5] are fed as inputs and the bit
selection operator at the end selects the
(k mod 5)

bit of the 5
bits long output
V .

Table 2: Control words
The operation PERM5 is a butterfly permutation, which is the
same as in the frequency hop selection scheme of Bluetooth and
it is described in Figure 14. Each bit of the control word
P is
associated with a given bit exchange in the input word. If the
given bit of the control word equals to 1 the corresponding bit exchange
is performed otherwise skipped. The control word
P is
obtained from
C and D, such that P [i] = D[i], i = 0 . . . 8 and
P [j + 9] = C[j], j = 0 . . . 4.
