Learning Query Languages of Web Interfaces
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the problem of automatic acquisition of
the query languages supported by a Web information resource
. We describe a system that automatically probes the
search interface of a resource with a set of test queries and
analyses the returned pages to recognize supported query
operators.
The automatic acquisition assumes the availability
of the number of matches the resource returns for
a submitted query. The match numbers are used to train
a learning system and to generate classification rules that
recognize the query operators supported by a provider and
their syntactic encodings. These classification rules are employed
during the automatic probing of new providers to
determine query operators they support. We report on results
of experiments with a set of real Web resources.
INTRODUCTION
Searching for relevant information is a primary activity
on the Web.
Often, people search for information using
general-purpose search engines, such as Google or Yahoo!,
which collect and index billions of Web pages. However,
there exists an important part of the Web that remains unavailable
for centralized indexing. This so-called "hidden"
part of the Web includes the content of local databases and
document collections accessible through search interfaces offered
by various small- and middle-sized Web sites, including
company sites, university sites, media sites, etc. According
to the study conducted by BrightPlanet in 2000 [6], the size
of the Hidden Web is about 400 to 550 times larger than the
commonly defined (or "Visible") World Wide Web. This
surprising discovery has fed new research on collecting and
organizing the Hidden Web resources [1, 2, 15, 17, 19].
Commercial approaches to the Hidden Web are usually in
the shape of Yahoo!-like directories which organize local sites
belonging to specific domains. Some important examples

of such directories are InvisibleWeb[1] and BrightPlanet[2]
whose gateway site, CompletePlanet[3], is a directory as
well as a meta-search engine. For each database incorporated
into its search, the meta-search engine is provided with
a manually written "wrapper", a software component that
specifies how to submit queries and extract query answers
embedded into HTML-formatted result pages.
Similar to the Visible Web, search resources on the Hidden
Web are highly heterogeneous. In particular, they use different
document retrieval models, such as Boolean or vector-space
models. They allow different operators for the query
formulation and, moreover, the syntax of supported operators
can vary from one site to another. Conventionally,
query languages are determined manually; reading the help
pages associated with a given search interface, probing the
interface with sample queries and checking the result pages
is often the method of choice.
The manual acquisition of Web search interfaces has important
drawbacks. First, the manual approach is hardly
scalable to thousands of search resources that compose the
Hidden Web. Second, the manual testing of Web resources
with probe queries is often error-prone due to the inability
to check results. Third, cases of incorrect or incomplete help
pages are frequent. Operators that are actually supported
by an engine may not be mentioned in the help pages, and
conversely, help pages might mention operators that are not
supported by the engine.
To overcome the shortcomings of the manual approach,
we address the problem of acquiring the query languages of
Web resources in an automatic manner. We develop a system
that automatically probes a resource's search interface
with a set of test queries and analyses the returned pages to
recognize supported query operators. The automatic acquisition
assumes the availability of the number of matches the
resource returns for a submitted query. The match numbers
are used to train a learning system and to generate classification
rules that recognize the query operators supported
by a provider and their syntactic encodings.
New technologies surrounding the XML syntax standard,
in particular Web Services [18], establish a new basis for automatic
discovery and information exchange and are becoming
widely employed in corporate applications.
However,
this has yet to happen for thousands of public information
providers. The question of when and how they will move
toward open cooperation using Web Service technologies remains
widely open [4]. Instead, the query-probing approach
for acquiring supported operators does not assume any cooperation
of Web providers; its only requirement is that they
1114
2004 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing
provide an accessible interface and allow queries to be run.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss
the heterogeneity of Web interfaces; we formalize the problem
and show its connection with the concept of learning by
querying in Section 3. In Section 4 we design a classifier system
for the automatic acquisition of a query language and
investigate different aspects of the system. In Section 6 we
review the prior art; in Section 5 we present experimental
results to illustrate the performance of our system. Section 7
discusses open issues and Section 8 concludes the paper.
QUERYING WEB RESOURCES
Web resources vary considerably in the ways they retrieve
relevant documents. In the theory of information retrieval,
there exist at least five basic retrieval models, but only three
of these models are visible on the Web, namely the Boolean,
the extended Boolean and the vector-space models. In the
Boolean query model, a query is a condition, which documents
either do or do not satisfy, with the query result being
a set of documents. In the vector-space model, a query is
a list of terms, and documents are assigned a score according
to how similar they are to the query. The query result
is a ranked list of documents. A document in the query result
might not contain all query terms. Finally, the extended
Boolean model combines the advantages of both the Boolean
and the vector-space query model. In this model, keywords
can be preceded by special characters (like + and - ) requiring
an obligatory presence or absence of a given keyword
in a document. For example, the query +information
+provider will retrieve all documents containing both keywords
and rank them according to some similarity function.
Analysis of information providers suggests that the majority
of providers adopt one of the three basic models. Moreover
, beyond query answers, many resources report the number
of documents in their collections matching the query. If
a resource deploys the (extended) Boolean model, the match
number shows how many documents match the query. In the
case of the vector-space model, the match number refers to
documents containing at least one query term, thus being
equivalent to the Boolean disjunction.
In the following, we develop an approach for automatic
determination of query operators by reasoning on submitted
queries and corresponding match numbers. Though this
approach excludes resources that do not report match numbers
, other ways of automatic detection of query operators
appear even more problematic and difficult to implement. A
method based on downloading answer documents and verifying
the query against their content often fails, either for legal
reasons, when the content of documents is unavailable or
password-protected, or for technical reasons, when a query
matches millions of documents and downloading even a part
of them requires prohibitive time and network resources.
2.1
Query language model
A query language of a Web provider includes a set of basic
operators and the way of combining the operators to get
complex queries. Basic operators have different arities, in
particular, the default term processing and the unary and
binary operators. The default processing refers primarily
to case sensitivity in this paper, but we could also refer to
whether the query term is treated as a complete word or as a
substring in a possible matching document. Unary operators
include the Stem-operator, which replaces a query term with
its lexem; binary operators include the Boolean operators 
(conjunction),  (disjunction), and ¬ (negation)
1
and the
operator P hrase which requires the adjacency of all terms
in a document.
Some other operators, like substring matching or word
proximity operators have been studied in various systems,
however the six query operators mentioned above are by far
the ones most frequently supported by Web interfaces. In
the following, we develop a method to cope with the operator
set O = {Case, Stem, , , ¬, P hrase}. Issues relevant
to the possible extension of set O with other operators are
delegated to Section 7.
2.2
Query interpretation
Web providers are queried by filling their search forms
with query strings. CGI or JavaScript code linked to the
query form interprets the query strings according to certain
rules.
These rules allow syntactic encodings for the supported
query operators. If correctly interpreted, the query
is executed on the document collection before a (full or partial
) answer is reported to the user.
Unfortunately, the same query operator may be encoded
differently by different providers. For example, the Boolean
conjunction is often encoded as A AND B , A B , or +A
+B , where A and B are query terms. Worse, two providers
can interpret the same query string differently. For example,
query string A B can be interpreted as a Boolean conjunction
, Boolean disjunction, or P hrase.
Example 1. To illustrate the problem, consider the query
string q = Casablanca AND Bogart .
On Google, AND
is interpreted as the Boolean conjunction, that is, i
Google
( Casablanca AND Bogart ) = Casablanca  Bogart . As
a result, query q matches 24,500 pages at Google, as op-posed
to 551,000 for query q
1
= Casablanca and 263,000
for q
2
= Bogart . On the Internet Movie Database (IMDB)
(http://www.imdb.com/.), AND is taken literally and all
terms in a query are implicitly OR-connected. Therefore, the
IMDB interprets query q as follows: i
IM DB
( Casablanca
AND Bogart ) = Casablanca  AND  Bogart . The
query returns 12,020 matches documents on IMDB, as op-posed
to only 22 for q
1
= Casablanca and 4 for q
2
= Bogart .
If we investigate an unknown query language, then Example
1 shows that observing match numbers for probe queries
can provide a good insight into the supported operators.
However, no definitive decision appears possible from the
three queries above q, q
1
, q
2
. An accurate decision on supported
operators/syntaxes will require probing the provider
with other queries and comparing all match numbers in order
to confirm or reject various hypotheses.
Example 2. As in Example 1, let us compare match numbers
for the queries q= Casablanca AND Bogart , q
1
= Casablanca
, and q
2
= Bogart . For Google, the fact that q matches
less documents than any of q
1
and q
2
, favors the Conjunction-hypotheses
, but is still insufficient to exclude other hypotheses
, like that of P hrase. Probing Google with query q
3
=
Bogart AND Casablanca returns the same number of matched
documents as q. This (most likely) discards the P hrase-hypothesis
, but not the hypothesis Casablanca  AND
1
Negation is a binary operator in Web query languages and
its interpretation is given by 'AND NOT', that is, A ¬ B is
a synonym for A ¬ B (the latter using the unary ¬).
1115
Bogart . To exclude this one, even more queries should be
sent to Google, like q
4
= Casablanca AND , and so on. Sim-ilarly
in IMDB, the fact that query q matches more documents
than q
1
and q
2
suggests that q is processed as a disjunction
, but it can not tell whether AND is taken literally
or ignored. A deeper analysis requires further probing
IMDB with, for example, queries q
4
= Casablanca AND or
q
5
= Casablanca Bogart to compare their match numbers to
the ones of previous queries and decide about the AND .
Our approach to the automatic acquisition of Web query
languages formalizes and generalizes the idea described in
Examples 1 and 2. We build a learning system that trains
a number of classifiers with data from manually annotated
sites to automatically determine supported operators and
their syntaxes at a new site. The training data from annotated
sites includes an ensemble of test queries together
with the corresponding match numbers.
PROBLEM DEFINITION
Assume an information provider P supports some or all
query operators in O; these operators form a set O
P
, O
P

O and allow us to compose a set of complex queries Q(O
P
).
For any operator o
i
O
P
, P accepts one or more syntactical
encodings, s
i1
, s
i2
, . . .. The set {s
ij
} of accepted syntaxes
for o
i
O
P
is denoted S
i
. The interpretation I
P
of operator
set O
P
is defined as I
P
= {(o
i
, s
ij
)|o
i
O
P
, s
ij
S
i
} =
{(o
i
, S
i
)|o
i
O
P
}. Interpretation I
P
is monovalued if each
operator has at most one syntax, i.e, |S
i
| = 1 for all o
i
O
P
.
I
P
is multivalued, if it allows multiple syntaxes for at least
one operator, i.e., o
i
O
P
such that |S
i
| &gt; 1. In Google,
the Boolean conjunction can be encoded by both AND and
(whitespace). Therefore, for any query terms A and B,
both query strings A B and A AND B are interpreted
as A  B. I
Google
contains (, AND ) and (,
) and is a
multivalued interpretation.
We distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous interpretations
. A pair of distinct operator encodings (o
i
, s
ij
)
and (o
k
, s
kl
) is ambiguous if the two operators have the same
syntax: o
i
= o
k
but s
ij
= s
kl
. An interpretation I
P
is ambiguous
, if it contains at least one ambiguous pair of encodings
. An interpretation I is unambiguous, if for any pair of
encodings (o
i
, s
ij
) and (o
k
, s
kl
) in I, o
i
= o
k
s
ij
= s
kl
.
Ambiguous interpretations can be observed with Web providers
that interpret query strings dynamically, when the final
decision depends on results of the query execution with
different retrieval models
2
. However, the major part of Web
providers interpret query strings unambiguously and our
method copes with unambiguous interpretations only. Further
discussion on ambiguous interpretations is in Section 7.
Like with the query operators, we select the most frequent
syntaxes on the Web, S = { Default
3
,  ,
, AND , + ,
OR , NOT , - , "" (quote marks)}. Like set O, these
syntaxes have been selected after verification of hundreds
of Web providers. Set S is easily extendable to alternative
syntaxes, like ones employed by non-English providers. For
2
Citeseer at http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs is an example
of ambiguous interpretation. By default, it interprets A
B as a conjunction; however if A  B matches zero documents
, the query is interpreted as disjunction.
3
'Default' refers to the absence of any syntax; it assumes
the processing of plain terms.
example, French providers may use ET for the Boolean
conjunction and OU for the disjunction.
The theoretical framework for the query language acquisition
is derived from the learning of an unknown concept
by querying [5]. Assume that provider P supports the basic
operators in O; complex queries composed from the basic
operators form a set Q(O). For the document collection at
P , query q  Q(O) constrains a subset P (q) of documents
matching q. An abstract query q  Q(O) is mapped into
a textual string with a mapping M : O  2
S
that defines
(possibly multiple) syntaxes for operators in O. The mapping
of a complex query q is denoted m(q), the set of mapped
queries is denoted Q(S) = Q(M (O)).
The sets O and S are assumed to be known, whereas the
mapping M is unknown. We are given an oracle that can
be queried with a mapped query m(q)  Q(S) on the size
of subset P (q), oracle(m(q)) = |P (q)|. By observing the or-acle's
responses to queries, the learning system should produce
a hypothesis on the mapping M , which should be as
close as possible to the correct one.
The identification of the mapping M may be simple under
certain circumstances. Below we show an example of reconstruction
when O
P
includes a particular subset of operators
and the oracle is noiseless.
Example 3. Let O include the three Boolean operators
(,  and ¬) and P hrase. Then, for a given syntax set S,
any unambiguous mapping M : O  2
S
can be exactly identified
if the oracle is noise-less
4
. In such a case, subset sizes
returned by the oracle fit the Boolean logic on sets.Indeed,
when querying the oracle with terms A and B and syntaxes
from S, the disjunction is distinguishable from other operators
by the fact that it constrains bigger subsets in a collection
than any of terms does:
|A  B|  |A|, |A  B|  |B|
(1)
Furthermore, among three other operators, the conjunction
is recognized by its commutativity:
|A  B| = |B  A|
(2)
Finally, the difference between negation and phrases is detected
by the basic equation linking three Boolean operators:
|A  B| = |A¬B| + |A  B| + |B¬A|
(3)
Sizes of subsets constrained by the Boolean operators satisfy
the disequation (1) and equations (2), (3) for any pair of
A and B, so one can easily design a learning system that
exactly identifies an unambiguous mapping M after only a
few probing queries.
Unfortunately, easy identification of the mapping M is
rather an exception on the real Web, where few if any of the
assumptions made in Example 3 become true. First, any
change in the operator set O
p
makes the exact reconstruction
less obvious. If the conjunction and/or disjunction are
not supported, then the size of A  B (or A  B) is unavailable
and equation (3) cannot help distinguish negation
from phrases. In cases like this, the identification of supported
syntaxes requires an analysis of the semantic correlation
between query terms A and B and guessing on their
co-occurrence in (unknown) document collections.
4
Oracle noiseless assumes the pure Boolean logics, with no
query preprocessing, like the stopword removal.
1116
Second, Web query interfaces that play the role of oracles
and return sizes of subsets constrained by queries m(q) 
Q(S) are rarely noiseless.
When probing interfaces with
test queries, the match numbers may violate equations (2)
and (3). Most violations happen because converting query
strings into queries on collections hides the stop-word removal
and term stemming. It is not clear, whether queries
like A AND B are interpreted as one (A is a stopword),
two, or three terms. Moreover, for the performance reasons,
real match numbers are often replaced by their estimations
which are calculated using various collection statistics [13],
without the real retrieval of documents matching the query.
LEARNING SYSTEM
To automatically determine supported query operators,
we reduce the overall problem to a set of classification tasks,
where each task is associated with recognizing a specific
query operator or syntax, and where some standard learning
algorithms like SVM, k-nearest neighbors or decision trees
can be applied. To build the classifiers, we collect and annotate
a set of Web providers. We develop a set of test queries
and probe all selected providers with the test queries. We
train the classifiers with query matches for test queries. For
any new provider, we first probe it with the test queries.
Query matches returned by the provider upon test queries
are used to automatically classify operators and syntaxes
and produce an unambiguous interpretation for P .
To achieve a good level of classification accuracy, we investigate
different aspects of the learning system including
the target function, probe queries, data preparation, and
feature encoding and selection.
4.1
Target function
Due to the multivalued relationships between query operators
and syntaxes, the target function for our learning
system has two alternatives, one for the direct mapping M
and the other one for the inverted mapping M
-1
:
· T
1
: O  2
S
. T
1
targets the unknown mapping M ;
it assigns zero or more syntaxes to each operator in
O. T
1
builds a multi-value classifier for every o
i
O,
or alternatively, a set of binary classifiers for all valid
combinations (o
i
, s
j
), o
i
O, s
j
S(o
i
).
· T
2
: S  O. T
2
targets the inverted mapping M
-1
; it
assigns at most one operator to every syntax s
j
S.
Either target function gets implemented as a set of classifiers
, operator classifiers for T
1
or syntax classifiers for T
2
.
Classifiers are trained with match numbers for probe queries
from annotated providers.
For a new provider P , either
function produces a hypothesis I
T
(P ) that approximates
the real interpretation I
P
. The major difference between
T
1
and T
2
is that the former can produce ambiguous interpretations
, while the output of T
2
is always unambiguous.
Indeed, two operator classifiers with T
1
can output the same
syntax leading to ambiguity, while each classifier in T
2
outputs
at most, one operator for one syntax. In experiments
we tested both functions, though when building the learning
system we put an emphasis on T
2
, which is free of ambiguity.
To build syntax classifiers for the target function T
2
, we
should consider beyond "good" classification cases for the
operators in O and include some "real-world" cases where
providers process syntaxes in S literally or simply ignore
them. For certain providers, it is difficult to find any valid
interpretation. In the learning system, we extend the set
of possible interpretations of syntaxes in S by three more
cases, O = O{Ignored, Literal, U nknown}. Syntaxes in
S have different alternatives for their interpretation; below
we revisit some syntaxes and report possible matches in O
as they are specified in the learning system.
Default : Case sensitivity for query terms: possible values
are case-insensitive (Case) or case-sensitive (Literal).
* : This unary operator can be interpreted as Stem, when
i(A*) = Stem(A), Ignored when i(A*) = i(A), and
Literal, when A* is accepted as one term.
: Whitespace is often a default for another syntax in
S. Three possible interpretations include the Boolean
conjunction when i( A B )= A  B, the Boolean disjunction
when i( A B )= A  B, and P hrase when
i( A B )= P hrase (A,B).
AND : Three alternatives here are the conjunction when
i( A AND B )= A  B, Ignored, when AND is ignored
and the interpretation goes with the whitespace
meaning, i( A AND B )= i( A B )= M
-1
(' ')
(A, B), and Literal when i( A AND B )= M
-1
(
)
(A, AND ,B).
" " (Quote marks): Two possible interpretations are P hrase,
when i( "A B" )= P hrase(A,B), and Ignore when quote
marks are ignored and terms are interpreted with the
whitespace, i( "A B" )= i( A B ) = M
-1
(
) (A, B).
A similar analysis is done for the syntaxes + ,
OR ,
NOT and - . Additionally, all syntaxes for binary operators
can be labeled as U nknown.
4.2
Probing with test queries
To train syntax classifiers for T
2
, we collect data from annotated
sites by probing their interfaces and extracting the
match numbers. Probing has a fairly low cost, but requires
a certain policy when selecting terms for test queries to provide
meaningful data for the learning. We define a set R
of model queries that contain syntaxes in S and parameter
terms A and B, which are later bound with real terms.
We form the set R by first selecting well-formed queries
that contain all syntaxes we want to classify. Second, we add
queries that are term permutations of previously selected
queries, for example the permutation B A for query A
B . Finally, we add model queries that are not well-formed,
but appear helpful for building accurate classification rules.
Below, the set R of model queries is illustrated using the
pair of terms A and B; model queries are split into three
groups containing one, two or three words:
· One word queries: A , B ,UpperCase(A), A* , Stem(A).
· Two word queries: A B , B A , "A B" , "B A" , +A
+B , +B +A , A -B , A AND , A OR , A NOT .
· Three word queries: A AND B , B AND A , A OR
B , B OR A , A NOT B , B NOT A .
In total, the set R is composed of 22 model queries, all in
lower case, except UpperCase (A), which is an upper case of
term A. Six queries in R are permutations of other queries
1117
and three queries are (purposely) not well-formed. These
queries A AND , A OR , A NOT are selected to help
detect Literal-cases for AND , OR , NOT .
Probe queries are obtained from the model queries by replacing
parameters A and B with specific query terms, like
knowledge and retrieval . These 22 probe queries form
a probe package denoted R
A,B
.
For a provider P , probe
queries together with corresponding match numbers form
the elementary feature set F
0
A,B
= {(m(q
i
), oracle(P (q
i
))),
w(q
i
)  R
A,B
}. Query terms are selected from a generic
English vocabulary with all standard stopwords excluded.
One site can be probed with one or more probe packages,
all packages using different term pairs (A,B).
To probe the sites with test queries, we bind model queries
in R with query terms. To obtain meaningful training data,
query terms should not be common stopwords, such as and
or the . As the term co-occurrence in a provider's document
collection is unknown, we select pairs with different degrees
of semantic correlation. Here, the term pairs fall into three
categories:
· C
1
: terms that form a phrase (such as A= information
and B= retrieval );
· C
2
: terms that do not form a phrase but occur in the
same document ( knowledge and wireless );
· C
3
: terms that rarely occur in the same document
(such as cancer and wireless ).
These three categories can be expressed through term co-occurrence
in some generic document collection P
G
.
We
re-use our query probing component to establish criteria for
term selection for the three categories. A pair of terms (A,
B) is in category C
1
(phrase co-occurrence) if the match
number for P hrase(A, B) is comparable with the conjunction
A  B, that is
|P
G
(P hrase(A,B))|
|P
G
(AB)|
&gt; , for some threshold
0 &lt;  &lt; 1. A term pair (A, B) is in category C
2
(high co-occurrence
) if the terms are not co-occurred in a phrase,
but their conjunction is comparable with either A or B,
|P
G
(AB)|
min{|P
G
(A)|,|P
G
(B)|}
&gt; , for some 0 &lt;  &lt; 1. If pair (A,B)
does not fit the conditions for categories C
1
and C
2
, then it
is in category C
3
(low co-occurrence). For our experiments,
we have selected Google as generic document collection G
and set the values of  and  both to 0.01.
4.3
Elementary features
Match numbers for probe queries in F
0
A,B
represent elementary
features that can be directly used to train classifiers
. Unfortunately, this often leads to poor results. The
reason is that Web resources considerably differ in size and,
therefore, the query matches from different resources are of
different magnitude and thus hardly comparable. A query
may match millions of documents on Google, but only a
few at a small local resource. To leverage the processing of
query matches from resources of different size, we develop
two alternative methods for the feature encoding.
In the first approach, we normalize the query matches in
F
0
by the maximum number of matches for the two basic
queries A and B . We thus obtain features F
1
with values
mostly between 0 and 1 (except for queries related to
the Boolean disjunction). The second approach F
2
to the
feature encoding, uses the "less-equal-greater"-relationship
between any two probe queries in a probe package. This
produces a three-value feature for each pair of test queries.
4.4
Feature selection
The refinement of raw features produces l=22 refined real
value features with F
1
and
l(l-1)
2
= 231 three-value features
with F
2
. The basic approach is to train each classifier with
the entire feature set F
0
, F
1
or F
2
. However, because of the
noise in the data, building accurate classifiers may require a
lot of training data. To control the amount of training data
and enhance the quality of classification rules, we proceed
with two methods of feature selection. First, we distinguish
between relevant and irrelevant features for a given classifier
and remove irrelevant ones. Second, beyond the direct
feature filtering, we use prior knowledge and classify new
syntaxes using previously classified ones.
Removing irrelevant features. The definition of relevant
features requires establishing syntactical dependencies
between model queries in R and semantic relationships between
syntaxes in S. Model query r
i
R syntactically depends
on model query r
j
if r
i
includes syntaxes present in
r
j
. Syntaxes s
i
and s
j
in S are semantically related if they
can be interpreted with the same operator in O.
We define the relevant feature set F
i
for syntax s
i
as containing
three parts, F S(s
i
) = F S
i
= F S
0
i
+ F S
1
i
+ F S
2
i
.
F S
0
i
simply contains all model queries r
j
R that involve
syntax s
i
, for example F S
0
( AND )= { A AND B , B AND
A , A AND }. Next, F S
1
i
contains model queries for syntactically
dependent syntaxes. Actually, F S
1
i
contains the
two model queries A B and B A for all binary syntaxes.
Finally, F S
2
1
contains the model queries for semantically related
syntaxes. For example, F S
2
( AND ) = F S
0
( + ), and
vice versa, F S
2
( + )=F S
0
( AND ).
Use of prior knowledge. Beyond removing irrelevant
features, it is possible to benefit from the dependencies between
syntaxes established in Section 4.1. For example, the
Literal-cases for OR and AND depend on the interpretation
of whitespaces. The classification of AND as Literal
becomes simpler when the system already knows that, for
example,
is interpreted as conjunction. To use the prior
knowledge, we alter the training and classification process.
We impose an order on the syntaxes in S. When training
or using syntax classifiers, we use the classification results
of previous syntaxes.
We convert the syntax set in the ordered list S
O
= (Default
,  ,
, "" , AND , + , OR ', NOT , - ) and impose
the order on how the classifiers are trained and used
for the classification. In the prior knowledge approach, the
feature set used to train the classifier for syntax s
i
S
O
will
include the classifications of all s
j
preceding s
i
in S
O
.
Removing irrelevant features and using prior knowledge
are two independent methods for feature selection and can
be applied separately or together. This allows us to consider
four feature selection methods for training classifiers and
classifying new sites:
1. Full feature set, F f s
i
= F , where F is a selected feature
encoding, F
0
, F

or F

2. Relevant feature set, Rf s

= F S

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
To run experiments, we collected and annotated 36 Web
sites with search interfaces. All sites report the match num-1118
bers for user queries and unambiguously interpret their query
languages. Selected sites represent a wide spectrum of supported
operator sets. For each site, we annotated all supported
operators and their syntaxes. For the extraction of
the match numbers from HTML pages we used the Xerox
IWrap wrapper toolkit [7, 12]. Out of 36 providers, only 4
support monovalued interpretations; in the other 32 cases,
at least one operator has two or more syntaxes.

Experimental framework
In all experiments we estimate the classification accuracy
for the individual operators in O (with T
1
) and the syntaxes
in S (with T
2
).
We also estimate the mean accuracy
for the target functions T
1
and T
2
. Experiments are
conducted using the cross-validation method. 36 annotated
sites are split into N =9 groups, S
1
, S
2
,. . . , S
N
. We run N
experiments; in experiment i, classifiers are trained with the
groups S
1
,. . . ,S
i-1
, S
i+1
,. . . ,S
N
and then tested with sites
from group S
i
. Accuracy (precision) values over N experiments
are averaged for each operator/syntax classifier and
form the individual accuracies. The average of individual
accuracies over O/S gives the mean accuracy.
We test the learning system by varying the system parameters
introduced in Section 4. We train and test classifiers
with three different learning algorithms: decision trees
from Borgelt's package (DT), k-nearest neighbors algorithm
(KNN), and support vector machines (SVM)
5
. The following
list recalls the test parameters and possible options.
1. Target function: T
1
includes |O |=9 operator classifiers
; multivalued interpretations are implemented as
classifications with subsets of |O |. For T
2
, the system
includes |S|=9 syntax classifiers.
2. Feature encoding: The three different feature encodings
(see Section 4.3) include the raw match numbers
given by F
0
, the normalized match numbers given by
F
1
, and three-value feature comparison given by F
2
.
3. Feature selection: The four methods presented in Section
4.4 include Ffs (full feature set), Rfs (relevant
feature set), PKfs (prior knowledge feature set) and
RPKfs (relevant prior knowledge feature set).
4. Term selection: We test three term selection categories
, C
1
, C
2
and C
3
introduced in Section 4.2. Additionally
, we test the mixture of the three categories,
when three term pairs are used to probe a site, i.e. one
term pair from each category C
1
, C
2
and C
3
.
Experiments have been run for all parameter combinations
; most combinations achieve mean accuracy superior to
60%. The four system parameters appear to be uncorrelated
in their impact on the classification results. To figure out
the most interesting ones, we determine overall "winners"
for each parameter, except for the learning algorithm. The
winners are T
2
target function, F
2
feature encoding, and
M ixed term selection.
RP Kf s feature selection behaves
best for DT and KNN and P Kf s feature selection is the
winner for SVM. We report more detail below.
5.2
Experimental Results
Decision trees are induced by the Borgelt's software; they
are then pruned using the confidence level (p=0.5) pruning
method. In SVM, linear kernel functions have been used.
For the KNN method, we report results for k=3 which behaves
better that k=1, 5 and 10. Because the implemen-tation
of the KNN algorithm cannot process large sets of
features, we were not able to test the Ffs and PKfs feature
selection methods.
All three learning algorithms show a similar performance.
3NN slightly outperforms DT and SVM for the "winner"
combination (86.42% against 84.26% and 79.74%), however
it is often less accurate with other parameter combinations.

Target functions and feature selection. The target functions
T
1
and T
2
implement alternative approaches to the
query language acquisition; T
1
uses operator classifiers while
T
2
uses syntax classifiers. As seen in Section 4, T
2
has an
advantage over T
1
because it avoids multivalued classification
and outputs only unambiguous interpretations, while
the output of T
1
should be further tested for unambiguity.
Thus we have built the learning system for T
2
. Series of
experiments conducted with T
1
and T
2
confirm the superiority
of T
2
. As operator classifiers in T
1
are trained indepen-dently
, their combined output does not guarantee unambiguity
. Unlike T
2
, high accuracy of individual classifiers may
not be translated into global good accuracy, because one
misclassification may produce an ambiguous interpretation
and undermine the good performance of other classifiers.
In practice, we test the output of operator classifiers of
T
1
and discard those that form ambiguous interpretations.
This gives a 2% to 10% drop in the mean accuracy. Figure 1
plots mean accuracies for T
1
and T
2
for all feature selection
methods (with fixed F
2
feature encoding and M ixed term
selection) and the three learning methods (only Rfs and RPKfs
could be measured for 3NN algorithm). Within feature
selection methods, keeping relevant features spurs the performance
of DT and 3NN better than the prior knowledge,
with their combination being the winner. For SVM, instead,
adding prior knowledge to the full feature set is the best
choice. In the following, all reported experiments refer to
the target function T
2
.
Feature encoding. Previous figures compared the mean
accuracies. We unfold the mean value and plot individual
accuracies for the syntaxes in S. Figure 2 plots accuracy values
for the three feature encoding methods (for T
2
-RP Kf sM
ixed combination for DT and 3NN and T
2
-P Kf s-M ixed
combination for SVM). As the figure shows, the pair-wise
comparison F
2
performs best with respect to the raw and
normalized match numbers.
Term selection. We complete the analysis of system parameters
by testing four methods of term selection. They
include categories C
1
, C
2
and C
3
and M ixed. Figure 3 plots
mean accuracies for all learning algorithms and four term selection
methods, giving M ixed as the winner.

KNN, and SVM.
5.3
Bias in training data
Among the syntaxes in S, all methods show only little difference
for the unary operators Def ault and Case. Among
the syntaxes for binary operators, certain (
, AND and
+ ) are easier to detect than others ( " " , OR and NOT ).
However, this phenomenon is not linked to the nature of the
operators or their syntaxes, but rather can be explained by
the bias in training data. In Table 1, we unfold the individual
accuracies and show results for each case (s, o), s 
S, o  O in the annotated data. Each non-empty cell in
Table 1 reports the occurrence of the case (in brackets) and
its classification accuracy. We can observe a definitive bias
of high accuracy for more frequent cases; instead, rare cases
have a very low accuracy. This explains good results for
,
AND and + , where occurrences are fairly split between
two main cases. For other syntaxes instead, the high error
ratio for rare cases decreases the individual accuracy.
RELATED WORK
The Hidden Web has emerged as a research trend and different
research groups have started to address various problems
relevant to organizing Hidden Web resources [15, 14,
17, 19, 20].
One focus is crawling; [17] presents a task-specific
and human-assisted approach to the crawling of the
Hidden Web.
The crawler searches for Hidden Web resources
relevant to a specific domain. The identification is
achieved by selecting domain-specific keywords from a fuzzy
set and assigning them to elements of HTML forms; the
resource is judged relevant if it returns valid search results.
Another important task is the classification of Hidden
Web resources. [15, 14] and [19] have developed approaches
to this problem based on query probing.
Moreover, [15]
makes use of the number of documents matching a submitted
conjunction query, as does our approach.
Instead of
query languages, they use match numbers to reason about
the relevance of a provider for a given category.
Originally, the query probing has been used for the automatic
language model discovery in [9], it probed documents
in a collection to analyze the content of the result pages.
[14] extends the work in [15] to the problem of database
selection by computing content summaries based on probing
. Once query language interfaces are understood, meaningful
query transformation becomes possible. [11] describes
one way of transforming a front-end query into subsuming
queries that are supported by the sources and a way to filter
out incorrectly returned documents. In [16], interaction
with online-vendors is automated.
In the close domain of meta-searching, the declaration of a
search resource's query features is often coupled with methods
of converting/translating meta-search queries into the
resource's native queries. Considerable research effort has
been devoted to minimizing the possible overheads of query
translation when the meta-search and search resource differ
in supporting basic query features [11]. In all these methods,
the manual discovery of the query features is assumed.
In information mediation systems that query Web resources
to materialize views on hidden data [20], one approach is to
reconstruct an image of a resource's database. Because of
a restricted Web interface, a critical problem is the entire
or partial reconstruction of the database image without the
unnecessary overload of the Web servers. [8] builds efficient
query covers that are accessible through nearest-neighbor
interfaces for the specific domain of spatial databases.
OPEN QUESTIONS
The experiments have raised a number of open questions
that require further research. Below we list some of them.
Stopwords. In tests, common English stopwords were
excluded from probing. However, the set of stopwords is

often domain-dependent; this should be taken into account
when generating test queries. A more difficult case is when
a resource treats terms as stopwords in a certain context.
For example, Google accepts the term "WWW" when it is
queried alone and ignores it when the term is conjuncted
with other terms. Such query-dependent treatment of stopwords
is considered as noise in the current system.
Acquiring other operators. We have addressed the
set of most frequently used query operators. Other operators
defined by existing document retrieval models, like
proximity operators, can be added to the operator set and
processed in a similar manner. Two remarks concerning less
frequent operators are that their syntactical encodings may
vary even more than for Boolean operators, and, more im-portantly
, finding sufficient training data to build reliable
classifiers may be technically difficult.
Query composition. The next issue is the manner in
which basic query operators are combined to form complex
queries. The most frequent manner on the Web is the use
of parentheses or a certain operator priority. How to detect
this remains an open problem at this point.
Ambiguous interpretations. Recognizing ambiguous
interpretations is the most difficult problem. One example
is Citeseer, which interprets whitespaces as conjunction by
default, but switches to disjunction if the conjunction query
matches no documents. Some other Web providers behave
in the same or a similar manner. We will need to extend
the learning system to include a possibility of triggering the
retrieval model as a function of the oracle answers.
CONCLUSION
We have addressed the problem of automatic recognition
of operators and syntaxes supported by query languages of
Web resources. We have developed a machine learning approach
based on reformulation of the entire problem as a set
of classification problems. By introducing various refined
solutions for the target function, feature encoding, and feature
selection, we have achieved 86% mean accuracy for the
set of the most frequent operators and syntaxes. Further
improvement in the accuracy is possible with better preparation
of annotated sites, but this is limited because of the
complexity of the a-priori unknown operator composition
and the noise produced by the hidden query preprocessing.
