Ranking Target Objects of Navigational Queries
ABSTRACT
Web navigation plays an important role in exploring public
interconnected data sources such as life science data. A
navigational query in the life science graph produces a result
graph which is a layered directed acyclic graph (DAG).
Traversing the result paths in this graph reaches a target
object set (TOS). The challenge for ranking the target objects
is to provide recommendations that reflect the relative
importance of the retrieved object, as well as its relevance to
the specific query posed by the scientist. We present a metric
layered graph PageRank (lgPR) to rank target objects
based on the link structure of the result graph. LgPR is
a modification of PageRank; it avoids random jumps to respect
the path structure of the result graph. We also outline
a metric layered graph ObjectRank (lgOR) which extends
the metric ObjectRank to layered graphs. We then present
an initial evaluation of lgPR. We perform experiments on
a real-world graph of life sciences objects from NCBI and
report on the ranking distribution produced by lgPR. We
compare lgPR with PageRank. In order to understand the
characteristics of lgPR, an expert compared the Top K target
objects (publications in the PubMed source) produced
by lgPR and a word-based ranking method that uses text
features extracted from an external source (such as Entrez
Gene) to rank publications.

INTRODUCTION
The last few years have seen an explosion in the number
of public Web accessible data sources, Web services and semantic
Web applications. While this has occurred in many
domains, biologists have taken the lead in making life science
data public, and biologists spend a considerable amount of
time navigating through the contents of these sources, to
obtain information that is critical to their research.
Providing meaningful answers to queries on life science
data sources poses some unique challenges. First, information
about a scientific entity, e.g., genes, proteins, sequences
and publications, may be available in a large number of autonomous
sources and several sources may provide different
descriptions of some entity such as a protein. Second,
the links between scientific objects (links between data entries
in the different sources) are important in this domain
since they capture significant knowledge about the relationship
and interactions between these objects. Third, interconnected
data entries can be modeled as a large complex
graph. Queries could be expressed as regular expression navigational
queries and can more richly express a user's needs,
compared to simpler keyword based queries.
Consider the following navigational query: Retrieve publications
related to the gene 'tnf ' that are reached by traversing
one intermediate (protein or sequence) entry. This query
expresses the scientist's need to expand a search for gene related
publications beyond those publications whose text directly
addresses the 'tnf' gene, while still limiting the search
to publications that are closely linked to gene entries.
Consider gene sources OMIM Gene and Entrez Gene, protein
sources NCBI Protein and SwissProt, sequences in NCBI
Nucleotide and biomedical publications in PubMed. Figure
1 represents the results of evaluating this navigational query
against these sources. The result is a layered DAG; we refer
to it as a result graph (RG). All paths in this directed result
graph (RG) start with data entries in the sources OMIM
Gene or Entrez Gene; this is the first layer. They visit one
intermediate data entry in sources NCBI Protein, Swiss Prot
or NCBI Nucleotide (second layer) and they terminate in a
publication data entry in PubMed (final layer).
The query returns all objects in PubMed that are reached

Figure 1: An example of a result graph (RG)
by traversing results paths; these PubMed entries are re-ferred
to as the target object set (TOS) reached by traversing
the result paths of the RG. In contrast, a keyword based
query would not have been able to specify the set of target
publications. Navigational queries, the RG and the target
object set (TOS) that answers the query are defined in the
paper.
It is difficult for a user to explore all target objects in a
reasonable amount of time and it is important to provide
a ranking of the TOS. As is well known, word based ranking
methods are very good at identifying the most relevant
results, typically using features extracted from the contents
of the target objects. For example [13] produces a ranking
of documents in PubMed that are most relevant to a gene.
In contrast, PageRank [11] focuses on the importance of the
target object and importance is transferred from other important
objects via the link structure. A recent technique
ObjectRank [1] addresses both relevance and importance; it
exploits schema knowledge to determine the correct authority
transfer between important pages. We note that there
is also research on ranking paths [2]. For term-based query
dependent ranking, we refer to [3, 12].
The focus of this paper is to produce a ranking method
to select the best target objects in the RG that answer the
navigational query. Our ideal ranking must identify target
objects that are both relevant and important. The ranking
must also be query dependent since we must guarantee that
the target objects that are ranked indeed occur in the RG
and answer the navigational query. Further, both relevance
and importance must be determined with respect to the objects
in TOS, rather than with respect to all the data entries
(as is the case with PageRank).
We propose two ranking metrics for the layered graph
RG; they are layered graph PageRank (lgPR) and layered
graph ObjectRank (lgOR). lgPR extends PageRank by distinguishing
different roles (intermediate node, answer node)
which can be played by the same node in the result graph.
It does not perform random jumps so as to respect the RG.
Our second metric lgOR is an extension to ObjectRank; due
to space limitations we only discuss it briefly.
We report on our preliminary evaluation of lgPR on a real
dataset from NCBI/NIH. For some navigational queries, we
apply lgPR to the corresponding RG and use the ranking
distribution for lgPR to illustrate that lgPR indeed discriminates
among the TOS objects. We also apply the original
PR metric to the object graph of life science data (against
which we evaluate the query). We compare with applying
lgPR to the actual RG to illustrate that lgPR and PR produce
dissimilar rankings.
Finally, we report on an initial user experiment. We consider
a set of complex queries typical of a scientist searching
for gene related PubMed publications, and the Top K
results of a word based ranking technique (Iowa) that has
been shown to be accurate in answering gene queries [13].
We compare the Iowa Top K publications with the lgPR Top
K publications, for some sample gene related queries, using
criteria that reflect both relevance and importance. We use
these criteria to understand the characteristics of lgPR.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the
data model, navigational query language and layered DAG
result graph. Section 3 presents PageRank, lgPR, ObjectRank
, and lgOR. 4 reports on preliminary results of an
experimental study with NCBI data and concludes.
DATA MODEL
We briefly describe a data model and navigational query
language for the life science graph. Details in [6, 9, 14].
2.1
Data Model for the Life Science Graph
The data model comprises three levels: ontology, source
and data (Figure 2). At the ontology level, a domain ontol-Gene
Marker
Publication
Nucleotide
Protein
Disease
OMIM

\NCBI
Gene
PubMed

Mappings
Figure 2: A Data Model for the Life Science Graph
ogy describes the universe of discourse, e.g., a gene, a pro-28
tein, etc., and the relationships among them. An ontology
graph OG = (C, L
C
) models the domain ontology, where
nodes in C represent classes, and edges in L
C
correspond to
relationships among classes. For example, genes and publications
are classes in OG and the association discuss relates
publications with genes.
In this paper, we only consider
one type of link, isRelatedTo, to capture the semantics of a
relationship; therefore, we omit all link labels.
At the source level, a source graph SG = (S, L
S
) describes
data sources and links that implement logical classes
(C) and associations (L
C
) in OG, respectively. For example,
PubMed and Entrez Gene are sources that implement the
logical classes publications and genes, respectively. A mapping
defines logical classes in C in terms of the sources in S
that implement them. A link between sources represents a
hyper-link, a service or an application that connects these
two sources. At the data level, a Data Graph is a graph
(D, L
D
), where D is a set of data entries and L
D
is a set
of references between entries. A mapping m
S
establishes
which data entries in D are published by source S.
2.2
Navigational Query Language
We define a query as a path expression over the alphabet
C in OG, where each class occurrence can optionally be an-notated
with a Boolean expression. The simplest Boolean
expression is the comparison of a Field to a particular value.
In this paper, a field can be either source or Object content,
and the relational operators can be "=" for source and "contains"
for Object content. A condition over source and the
relational operator "=", (source = "name-of-source"), restricts
the query to some specific sources that implement
the class. A condition on Object content and the relational
operator "contains", specifies the set of keywords that must
occur within objects in the Data Graph. The symbol
is
a wild-card matching any class and the "." represents any
relationship.
The query: Retrieve publications that are related to the
gene "tnf or aliases in human" in OMIM or Enrtez Gene,
and are reached by traversing one intermediate resource, is
expressed in the navigational query language as follows: Q =
Gene[Object content contains
{"tnf" and aliases in human}
and source = OMIM or Entrez Gene]
·
· Publication
The answer to a query Q is defined at the three levels of
the data model. It comprises three sets of paths:
OG
(Q),

SG
(Q) and
DG
(Q). The meaning of query Q with respect
to the ontology graph OG,
OG
(Q), is the set of simple paths
in OG that correspond to words in the language induced by
the regular expression Q. The meaning of the query with
respect to the source graph SG,
SG
(Q), is the set of all
simple paths in SG that correspond to mappings of the paths
in
OG
(Q). Finally, the answer for query Q with respect to
the data graph DG,
DG
(Q), is the set of simple paths in
DG that are the result of mapping the paths in
SG
(Q)
using mapping function m
S
. A simple path does not repeat
(revisit) the same class, data source or data entry (in the
same path).
The queries that are presented in this section are typical
queries posed by researchers. At present, there are no
query evaluation engines to answer navigational queries and
researchers must rely on manual navigation via browsers or
they must write scripts; the latter involves labor to keep
writing the scripts and the scripts may be inefficient in answering
these queries.
2.3
Result Graph
The union of paths in
DG
(Q) is the result graph RG. We
note that for our query language, all the paths that satisfy
a query are of the same length, i.e., all the paths in the
sets
OG
(Q),
SG
(Q) and
DG
(Q) are of the same length.
We model a result graph RG
Q
= (D
RG
, L
RG
) for a query
Q, as a layered directed acyclic graph comprising k layers,
L
1
, ..., L
k
, where k is determined by the query. The set of
nodes D
RG
corresponds to the union of the data entries that
appear in the paths in
DG
(Q). L
RG
represents the links
among these data entries. A layer L
i
is composed of the
union of the data entries in the paths
DG
(Q) that appear
in the i-th position of the paths. The data entries in the
k-th layer are called the target objects and they form the
target object set (TOS) of the RG.
Note that since the result graph has multiple paths, and
since a source may occur in different layers of these paths,
the same data entry may appear multiple times in the different
layers, depending on its connectivity to other data
entries. In this case, each occurrence of the data entry is
represented independently within each layer/path in which
it occurs. The result graph framework distinguishes the different
roles (intermediate node, answer node) which can be
played by the same node in the result graph.
Figure 1 is a layered RG for the following query: Retrieve
publications related to the gene "tnf " traversing one intermediate
source; it has three layers. The first layer corresponds
to the genes in the sources OMIM Gene and Entrez Gene
that are related to the keyword "tnf". The second layer are
the entries in the sources NCBI Protein, Swiss Prot or NCBI
Nucleotide that are reached by objects in the first layer. Finally
, the target objects in the third layer (TOS) are the
publications in PubMed that are linked to the objects in
the second layer.
RANKING METRICS
We briefly describe the PageRank metric [11] and then
discuss our metric lgPR for layered DAGs. We briefly discuss
the ObjectRank metric [1] and our extension lgOR.
3.1
PageRank
PageRank assumes that links between pages confer authority
. A link from page i to page j is evidence that i is
suggesting that j is important. The importance from page
i that is contributed to page j is inversely proportional to
the outdegree of i. Let N
i
be the outdegree of page i. The
corresponding random walk on the directed web graph can
be expressed by a transition matrix A as follows:
A[i, j] =
1
N
i
if there is an edge from i to j
0
otherwise
Let E be an arbitrary vector over the webpages, representing
the initial probability of visiting a page. Let d be
the probability of following a link from a page and let (1
-d)
be the probability of a random jump to a page. The PageRank
ranking vector R = dA
· R + (1 - d)E. R converges for
the web graph with any E, since generally the web graph is
aperiodic and irreducible[5, 10].
PageRank cannot be directly applied to a layered graph.
A Markov Chain is irreducible if and only if the graph contains
only one strongly connected component. RG is not
29
outgoing links with respect to the query.
There are several potential ways to extend PageRank for
RG. First, one can ignore links that point to pages without
outgoing edges since these pages do not affect the ranking
of other pages [11]. However we are specifically interested
in obtaining a ranking for the TOS or the objects in the
last layer of the layered result graph RG with no outgoing
links, we cannot ignore these pages.
Another possibility
is modifying the transition matrix probability so that one
takes a random jump from a node in the TOS [5]. This
will ensure that the graph will be irreducible and aperiodic.
However, this would arbitrarily modify RG whose structure
is determined by the query; modifying RG will not assure
that it answers the query. To summarize, the extensions to
PageRank in the literature cannot be applied to the problem
of ranking the target object set TOS of RG.
3.2
Layered Graph PageRank(lgPR)
We describe layered graph PageRank to rank the TOS.

Table 1: Symbols used by lgPR
The layered DAG result graph RG is represented by a
transition matrix A
lg
to be defined next. Note that an object
in the object graph may occur in multiple paths of the
result graph, in different layers; it will be replicated in the
transition matrix for each occurrence. Each object u at layer
p will have an entry in the transition matrix to some object
v at layer q. We denote the occurrence of them as u
p
and
v
q
respectively.
The ranking vector R is defined by a transition matrix
A
lg
and initial ranking vector R
ini
, is as follows:
R = A
k
-1
lg
R
ini
= (
k

l=1
A
lg
) R
ini
We pick R
ini
as follows: the entry for an object in R
ini
is
1 if this object is a link in start layer and 0 otherwise. The
transition matrix A
lg
is computed as follows:
A
lg
[i

u
, j

] =

OutDeg

p
)
if OutDeg
RG
(u
p
) &gt; 0
and e(u
p
, v
q
)
E
RG
,
0
otherwise.
Note that we define the outdegree of each object in RG
to only consider those edges that actually occur in RG and
link to objects in the next layer. This reflect the probability
that a user follows an object path in the RG. In contrast,
PageRank considers all outgoing edges from a page.
Unlike PageRank, lgPR differentiates the occurrence of a
data entry in different layers, as well as the links to entries
in subsequent layers; lgPR is thus able to reflect the role of
objects and links (from the entire graph of data entries) in
answering a navigational query. Suppose an object a occurs
in an intermediate layer as well as in the TOS of the RG. It
is possible that a is able to convey authority to other objects
in the TOS. However, a may not rank very high in the TOS
for this query. This characteristic is unique to lgPR. Thus,
the score associated with the object is query dependent to
reflect the role played by the object in the result graph.
3.2.2
Convergence Property
This transition matrix A
lg
is neither irreducible nor aperiodic
as all rows for target objects contain only 0's. The
matrix A is a nilpotent matrix and the number of layers is
the index. We provide two defintions (details in [8]).
Definition
3.1. A square matrix A is a nilpotent matrix,
if there exists some positive integer k such that A
k
= 0 but
A
k
-1
= 0. Integer k is known as the index of A.
Definition
3.2. Let k be the index of A.
{A
k
-1
x, A
k
-2
x,
..., Ax, x
} form a Jordan Chain, where x is any vector such
that A
k
-1
x = 0.
A characteristic of a nilpotent matrix is that its only eigenvalue
is 0. The consequence is that any vector x is an eigenvector
of A as long as Ax = 0. From the previous definition
{A
k
-1
lg
R
ini
, A
k
-2
lg
R
ini
, ..., A
lg
R
ini
, A
lg
} forms a Jordan
Chain, since A
k
-1
lg
R
ini
= 0.
We show following two lemmas without providing proof
in this paper.
Lemma
3.3. Jordan chain
{A
k
-1
lg
R
ini
, A
k
-2
lg
R
ini
, ...,
A
lg
R

, A
lg
} is a linearly independent set.
Lemma
3.4.
{A
k
-1
lg
R
ini
, A
k
-2
lg
R
ini
, ..., A
lg
R
ini
, A
lg
} consists
of a sequence of ranking vectors. In R
ini
, only objects
in layer 0 have non-zero scores; In ranking vector A
m
lg
R
ini
,
only objects in layer m receive non-zero scores.
The final ranking vector by lgPR is the first eigenvector
in the Jordan Chain, given the above initial ranking vector
R
ini
and the transition matrix A
lg
. While the traditional
PageRank algorithm converges on a ranking in multiple iterations
, lgPR can be computed in exactly k
- 1 iterations.
Note that because RG is a layered DAG, we can use link
matrices, each of which represents links between neighboring
layers, instead of the single transition matrix A
lg
for the
entire graph. We also use keywords to filter query answers
at each iteration.
3.3
Layered Graph ObjectRank(lgOR)
PR is computed a priori on the complete data graph and is
independent of the RG. A recent technique ObjectRank [1]
extends PageRank to consider relevance of query keywords.
It exploits schema knowledge to determine the correct authority
transfer in a schema graph.
In ObjectRank, the
authority flows between objects according to semantic connections
. It does so by determining an authority weight for
each edge in their schema graph. The ranking is (keyword)
query dependent.
Due to space limitations, we do not provide the details
of the ObjectRank metric. Instead, we briefly describe how
irreducible since the last layer in RG contains nodes with no
30
the transition matrix for lgPR can be extended to consider
the authority weights associated with edges that occur in
RG.
Consider a metric layered graph ObjectRank(lgOR). The
difference from lgPR is the transition matrix A
OG
. It is as
follows:
A[i
p
u
, j
q
v
] =
(e
E
RG
)
if e(u
p
, v
q
)
E
RG
,
0
otherwise.
(e
E
RG
) =
(e
ESG
)
OutDeg(u
p
,e
ESG
)
if OutDeg(u
p
, e
E
SG
) &gt; 0
0
if OutDeg(u
p
, e
E
SG
) = 0
Let the edge between u
p
and v
q
map to an edge E
SG
in
the SG. (E
SG
) represents the authority transfer weight
associated with E
SG
. OutDeg(u
p
, e
E
SG
) is the outdegree in
RG of type E
SG
.
As discussed in [1], the success of ObjectRank depends on
correctly determining the authority weight to be associated
with each link. Figure 3 (next section) illustrates the source
graph that we use in our evaluation of navigational queries.
For lgOR to be successful, an authority weight may have
to be associated with each link in each result path (type)
in the RG. Experiments with users to determine the correct
authority weights for lgOR is planned for future work.
Currently the importance is computed after query evaluation
. We compute result graph first, then ranking, for
the reason that the transition matrix is defined in terms of
outdegree in the RG. This motivates further research of combination
of two problems, whose ideal solution is to ranking
objects during query evaluation.
EXPERIMENTS ON LGPR
We report on experiments on real world data. We show
that the lgPR ranking distribution has the ability to differentiate
among the target objects of the RG and it is different
from PageRank. A user compared the Top K results
of lgPR and a word based ranking (Iowa) [13], using criteria
that reflect both importance and relevance, to determine
their characteristics.
4.1
Experiment Setting
NCBI/NIH is the gatekeeper for biological data produced
using federal funds in the US
1
. We consider a source graph
SG of 10 data sources and 46 links. Figure 3 presents the
source graph used in this task.We used several hundred keywords
to sample data from these sources (the EFetch utility)
and followed links to the other sources (the ELink utility).
We created a data graph of approximately 28.5 million objects
and 19.4 million links. We note that several objects are
machine predicted objects so it is not uncommon that they
have no links. The object identifiers for the data entries
(nodes of the data graph) and the pair of object identifiers
(links) were stored in a DB2 relational database.
Table 2 identifies the queries and keywords that were used
in this experiment. The symbols g, p, n, s refer to classes
gene, publication, nucleotide and SNP, respectively. Note
that
is the wild card and can match all the classes and
sources (in the source graph).
For each navigational query, the source paths that answer
the query were determined using an algorithm described in

Table 2: Experiment setting
[14]. Evaluating the paths in the data graph for each source
path was implemented by SQL queries. Since a result graph
RG could involve multiple source paths whose computation
may overlap we applied several multiple query optimization
techniques. The SQL queries were executed on DB2 Enterprise
Server V8.2 installed on a 3.2 GHz Intel Xeon processor
with 1GB RAM. The execution time for these queries varied
considerably, depending on the size and shape of RG. If we
consider the query g.n.p with keyword "degenerative joint"
used to filter 'g', one source path was ranked in approximately
1 second. However, the query (g. . . .p) with the
keyword aging used to filter 'g' created a very large result
graph and the execution time for this was approximately
2000 seconds. Typically the We note that computing the
high scoring TOS objects of the RG efficiently is a related
but distinct optimization problem.
4.2
lgPR Distribution
We report on the query (g. .p), i.e., paths from genes to
publications via one intermediate source.
Figures 4 and 5 report on the distribution of scores produced
by the lgPR metric for the target objects in TOS
for some representative queries. The first 10 bars represent
scores in the range (0.00-0.01) to (0.09-0.1) and the last bar
represents the range (0.1-1.0).
Fig 4 shows that a small
number of objects have very high score and the majority
have a low score. As expected, many queries and keywords
produced distributions that were similar to Figure 4. Most
of the objects in TOS, in this case approx. 12,000 objects,
had a very low score, and less than 200 object had a score
in the range (0.1-1.0).
However, we made an interesting observation that some
queries produced distributions that were similar to Figure
5. In this case, while many of the results (approx. 120) had
low scores in the range (0.00-0.02), 46 objects had scores in
the range (0.1-1.0) and 120 objects had scores in between.

Finally, we compared the ranking produced by lgPR and
PageRank. We apply PageRank to the entire data graph
of 28.5 million objects and 19.4 million links described in
section 4.1. For the three sample queries (described in the
next section), there are no PubMed ID's in common to the
Top 25, 50, 100 for each of the queries, except that the
top 50 of query with Lash term "allele" have 1 PubMed
publications in common, and top 100 of same query have 3
in common. We speculate that the link structure of the RG
is distinct compared to the link structure of the data graph;
hence applying lgPR to the RG results in dissimilar ranking
compared to a priori applying PageRank to the entire data
graph.
We summarize that the lgPR score can both identify those
objects with a very low ranking that may not be of interest
to the user. However, it can also be used to discriminate
amongst objects in the TOS whose ranking has a much lower
variation of scores. Finally, lgPR ranking is not the same
as that produced by PageRank applied to the entire data
graph.

User Evaluation
In our user evaluation of lgPR, we consider a set of complex
queries typical of a scientist searching for gene related
PubMed publications, and the Top K results of a word based
ranking technique (Iowa) that has been shown to be accurate
in answering gene queries [13]. We compare the Iowa Top
K publications with the lgPR Top K publications, for some
sample gene related queries.
We use criteria that reflect
both relevance and importance to identify characteristics of
lgPR.
Researchers are particularly interested in genetic and phe-notypic
variations associated with genes; these phenomena
are often studied in the context of diseases, in a chromoso-mal
region identified by a genomic marker (a unique known
sequence) associated with the disease. Genetic and pheno-typic
knowledge are described using terms of the Lash controlled
vocabulary [7]. We focus on a branch of the Lash
vocabulary that relates to phenotypes and population genetics
. Terms of interest include linkage disequilibrium,
quantitative trait locus and allele. Figure 6 presents
a portion of the Lash controlled vocabulary (term hierarchy
). LD is not listed as the synonym to the term linkage
disequilibrium, because LD may often refer to another concept
. In the following experiment, we did not consider the
plural form of some terms, such as alleles to allele, but this
can be extended in the future studies.

The navigational query used in our evaluation experiment
can be described in English as follows: "Return all publications
in PubMed that are linked to an Entrez Gene entry
that is related to the human gene TNF (or its aliases). The
entry in PubMed must contain an STS marker and a term
from the Lash controlled vocabulary."
We used the query term "TNF AND 9606[TAXID]"
2
to
sample data from Entrez Gene. We then followed 8 paths to
PubMed. Table 3 reports on the number of entries in Entrez
Gene as well as the cardinality of the TOS for some sample
queries
3
.
We briefly describe the word-based ranking method (Iowa)
that focuses on ranking documents retrieved by PubMed
2
Note the Taxonomy ID for human is 9606 [4], and term
9606[TAXID] was used to select human genes.

Table 3: Cardinality of TOS
for human gene queries [13], so that relevant documents are
ranked higher than non-relevant documents. This method
relies on using post-retrieval queries (ranking queries), au-tomatically
generated from an external source, viz., Entrez
Gene (Locus Link), to rank retrieved documents. The research
shows that ranking queries generated from a combination
of the Official Gene Symbol, Official Gene Name,
Alias Symbols, Entrez Summary, and Protein Products (optional
) were very effective in ranking relevant documents
higher in the retrieved list. Documents and ranking queries
are represented using the traditional vector-space representation
, commonly used in information retrieval.
Given a
gene, the cosine similarity score between the ranking query
vector for the gene and each document vector is computed.
Cosine scores are in the [0, 1] range and documents assigned
a higher score are ranked higher than documents with a
lower score. In the absence of summary and protein product
information, ranking queries generated from the gene
symbol, name and aliases are used to rank retrieved documents
. In this experiment study we are working on the Bio
Web documents alone.
We use the following criteria to compare the Top K results
from Iowa and lgPR, to understand basic characteristics of
the two methods. Criteria labeled R appear to judge the
relevance of the paper and those labeled I appear to judge
importance. Some criteria appear to judge both and are
labeled R,I.
1. R: Does the title or abstract of the article contain the
term TNF or its aliases in human? Does the article
discuss immune response?
2. R,I: Does the article contain any disease related terms?
Does the article contain any genomic components (genes,
markers, snps, sequences, etc.)?
3. R,I: Does the article discuss biological processes related
to the Lash terms?
4. R,I: What is the connectivity of the article to gene
entries in Entrez Gene that are related to TNF? Note
that as shown in Table 3, there are 649 Entrez Gene
entries that are related to human gene TNF. Each
PubMed publication was reached by following a result
path through the result graph RG that started
with one of these Entrez Gene entries. However, some
PubMed publications may have been reached along
multiple paths in the RG reflecting much greater connectivity
.
5. I: What is the category of the article (review, survey,
etc.). Does the article address some specific topics or
is it a broad brush article?
6. I: Where did the article appear? What is the journal
impact factor? Has the article been highly cited?

Table 5: Relevance and Importance of Top 10 Puli-cations
Reported by lgPR Ranking Method
Tables 4 and 5 report Top 10 publications in PubMed that
are linked to an Entrez Gene entry that is related to human
gene TNF and contain the term linkage disequilibrium.
The first column reports the PubMed identifiers (PMIDs)
of the Top 10 publications returned by the Iowa and the
lgPR ranking methods. The human evaluation results are
reported in the fourth to the ninth columns using the the
six criteria listed above. An H represents the publication
is highly matched to the correspoinding criteria (M and L
represents medium and low respectively). An H indicates:
1. The PubMed entry is linked to the human gene TNF
with Entrez Gene identifier GeneID:7124.
2. The publication contains both diseases related terms
and genomic components.
3. The publication contains multiple Lash terms.
4. The connectivity is high, if there are more than five
related gene entries linked to the publication.
5. A research article considered more important than a
review or a survey, and a more specific topic is better.
6. The article is published in a journal with the impact
factor higher than 10.0, or the article is cited by ten
or more publications.
We then score the relevance (rel.) and the importance
(imp.) in the second and the third columns by combining
33
the number of H and M reported in the six criteria. Criteria
1 weighs twice compared to the other five criteria. We
use a number between 0 and 5, in which 5 indicates the
corresponding PubMed entry is highly relevant or highly
important to the given query. While both rankings appear
to identify "good" documents, Iowa appears to favor relevant
documents based on their word content. lgPR appears
to exploit the link structure of the RG, and have higher in-terconnectivity
to TNF related entries in Entrez gene. The
publications retrieved by lgPR are more likely to contain
diseases related terms or genomic components. The Iowa
ranking has a primary focus on the relevance of documents
(based on document contents; it is not able to differentiate
the importance of these relevant documents. In contrast,
lgPR has a primary focus on importance (based on the link
structure of the result graph); it is not able to differentiate
the relevance of important documents. We conclude that
further study is needed to determine how we can exploit the
characteristics of both methods.
There is no intersection between two sets of Top 10 publications
returned by these two ranking methods. The first
common PMID is 7935762, which is ranked 24 in the Iowa
method and 21 by the lgPR method.
CONCLUSIONS
We have defined a model for life science sources. The answer
to a navigational query are the target objects (TOS) of
a layered graph Result Graph (RG). We define two ranking
metrics layered graph PageRank (lgPR) and layered graph
ObjectRank (lgOR). We also report on the results of experiments
on real world data from NCBI/NIH. We show that
the ranking distribution of lgPR indeed discriminates among
the TOS objects of the RG. The lgPR distribution is not the
same as applying PageRank a priori to the data graph. We
perform a user experiment on complex queries typical of
a scientist searching for gene related PubMed publications,
and the Top K results of a word based ranking technique
(Iowa) that has been shown to be accurate in answering gene
queries the query. Using criteria that judge both relevance
and importance, we explore the characteristics of these two
rankings. Our preliminary evaluation indicates there may
be a benefit or a meta-ranking.
We briefly presented layered graph ObjectRank (lgOR)
which is an extension to ObjectRank.
The challenge of
ObjectRank is determining the correct authority weight for
each edge. For lgOR, we need to find the weight for the
edges that occur in RG. Experiments with users to determine
the correct authority weights for lgOR is planned for
future work. We expect that IR techniques can be used to
determine authority weights.
