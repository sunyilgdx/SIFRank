Translating Unknown Cross-Lingual Queries in Digital Libraries Using a Web-based Approach
ABSTRACT
Users' cross-lingual queries to a digital library system might be 
short and not included in a common translation dictionary 
(unknown terms). In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of 
exploiting the Web as the corpus source to translate unknown 
query terms for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) in 
digital libraries. We propose a Web-based term translation 
approach to determine effective translations for unknown query 
terms by mining bilingual search-result pages obtained from a real 
Web search engine. This approach can enhance the construction of 
a domain-specific bilingual lexicon and benefit CLIR services in a 
digital library that only has monolingual document collections. 
Very promising results have been obtained in generating effective 
translation equivalents for many unknown terms, including proper 
nouns, technical terms and Web query terms.

INTRODUCTION
With the development of digital library technologies, large 
amounts of library content and cultural heritage material are being 
digitized all over the world. As digital library systems become 
commonly constructed and digitized content becomes widely 
accessible on the Web, digital libraries that cross language and 
regional boundaries will be in increasingly high demand globally. 
Unfortunately, most of existing digital library systems only 
provide monolingual content and search support in certain target
languages. To facilitate a cross-language information retrieval 
(CLIR) service in digital library systems, it is important to 
develop a powerful query translation engine. This must be able to 
automatically translate users' queries from multiple source 
languages to the target languages that the systems accept.
Conventional approaches to CLIR incorporate parallel texts [16] 
as the corpus. These texts contain bilingual sentences, from which 
word or phrase translations can be extracted with appropriate 
sentence alignment methods [7]. The basic assumption of such an 
approach is that queries may be long so query expansion methods 
can be used to enrich query terms not covered in parallel texts. 
However, this approach presents some fundamental difficulties for 
digital libraries that wish to support practical CLIR services. First, 
since most existing digital libraries contain only monolingual text 
collections, there is no bilingual corpus for cross-lingual training. 
Second, real queries are often short, diverse and dynamic so that 
only a subset of translations can be extracted through the corpora 
in limited domains. How to efficiently construct a domain-specific 
translation dictionary for each text collection has become a major 
challenge for practical CLIR services in digital libraries. In this 
paper, we propose a Web-based approach to deal with this 
problem. We intend to exploit the Web as the corpus to find 
effective translations automatically for query terms not included 
in a dictionary (unknown terms). Besides, to speedup online 
translation process of unknown terms, we extract possible key 
terms from the document set in digital libraries and try to obtain 
their translations in advance.
For some language pairs, such as Chinese and English, as well as 
Japanese and English, the Web offers rich texts in a mixture of 
languages. Many of them contain bilingual translations of proper 
nouns, such as company names and personal names. We want to 
realize if this positive characteristic makes it possible to 
automatically extract bilingual translations of a large number of 
query terms. Real search engines, such as Google
1
and AltaVista
2
,
allow us to search English terms for pages in a certain language, 
e.g. Chinese or Japanese. This has motivated us to develop the 
proposed approach for mining bilingual search-result pages, 
which are normally returned in a long, ordered list of snippets of 
summaries to help users locate interesting documents. The 
proposed approach uses the bilingual search-result pages of 
unknown queries as the corpus for extracting translations by 
utilizing the following useful techniques: (1) Term extraction

methods that extract translation candidates with correct lexical 
boundaries. (2) Term translation methods that determine correct 
translations based on co-occurrence and context similarity 
analysis.
Several preliminary experiments have been conducted to test the 
performance of the proposed approach. For example, very 
promising translation accuracy has been obtained in generating 
effective translation equivalents for many unknown terms, 
including proper nouns, technical terms and Web query terms. 
Also, it has been shown that the approach can enhance bilingual 
lexicon construction in a very efficient manner and thereby benefit 
CLIR services in digital libraries that only have monolingual 
document collections. In Section 2 of this paper, we examine the 
possibility of using search-result pages for term translation. The 
technical details of the proposed approach, including the term 
extraction and term translation methods, are presented with some 
experiments in Sections 3 and 4 respectively. An application of 
the proposed approach to bilingual lexicon construction is 
described in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6 we list our 
conclusions.

OBSERVATIONS AND THE PROPOSED APPROACH
A large number of Web pages contain a mixture of multiple 
languages. For example, Chinese pages on the Web consist of rich 
texts in a mixture of Chinese (main language) and English 
(auxiliary language), many of which contain translations of proper 
nouns and foreign terms. In fact, in the Chinese writing style, the 
first time a foreign term appears in the text, we might also write 
its original word, e.g., "" (Yahoo). In our research, we are 
seeking to determine if the percentage of correct translations for 
real queries is high enough in the top search-result pages. If this is 
the case, search-result-based methods can be useful in alleviating 
the difficulty of term translation. According to our observations, 
many query terms are very likely to appear simultaneously with 
their translations in search-result pages. Figure 1 illustrates the 
search-result page of the English query "National Palace 
Museum", which was submitted to Google to search Chinese 
pages. Many relevant results were obtained, including both the 
query itself and its Chinese aliases, such as "" 
(National Palace Museum), "" (an abbreviation of National 
Palace Museum) and "" (Palace Museum), which 
might not be covered in general-purpose translation dictionaries.

Figure 1. An illustration showing translation equivalents, such
as National Palace Museum/"" (""),
which co-occur in search results returned from Google.
Although search-result pages might contain translations, the 
difficulties in developing a high-performance search-result-based 
term translation approach still remain. For example, it is not 
straightforward to extract translation candidates with correct 
lexical boundaries and minimum noisy terms from a text. It is also 
challenging to find correct translations for each unknown term 
within an acceptable number of search-result pages and an 
acceptable amount of network access time. To deal with these 
problems, the proposed approach contains three major modules: 
search-result collection, term extraction and term translation, as 
shown in Figure 2 (a). In the search-result collection module, a 
given source query (unknown term) is submitted to a real-world 
search engine to collect top search-result pages. In the term 
extraction module, translation candidates are extracted from the 
collected search-result pages using the term extraction method. 
Finally, the term translation module is used to determine the most 
promising translations based on the similarity estimation between 
source queries and target translations.
In fact there are two scenarios to which the proposed approach can 
be applied. Except online translation of unknown queries, another 
application is offline translation of key terms as in Figure 2 (b). 
To reduce unnecessary online translation processes, the proposed 
approach can be used to augment the bilingual lexicon via 
translating key terms extracted from the document set in a digital 
library. These extracted key terms are likely to be similar to terms 
that users may use in real user queries. The proposed approach 
can be applied to those unknown key terms to obtain their 
translations with an offline batch process (the extracted 
translations might be edited by indexers). Furthermore, the 
constructed bilingual lexicon can be incrementally updated with 
the input of unknown queries from users and the performing of 
online translation processes. To facilitate the above scenarios the 
proposed term extraction and term translation techniques are 
required, which will be further described in the following sections.

TERM EXTRACTION
The first challenge of the proposed approach is: how to efficiently 
and effectively extract translation candidates for an unknown 
source term from a set of search-result pages. Other challenging 
issues include: whether all possible translations can be extracted 
and whether their lexical boundaries can be correctly segmented. 
Conventionally, there are two types of term extraction methods 
that can be employed. The first is the language-dependent 
linguistics-based method that relies on lexical analysis, word 
segmentation and syntactic analysis to extract named entities from 
documents. The second type is the language-independent 
statistics-based method that extracts significant lexical patterns 
without length limitation, such as the local maxima method [19] 
and the PAT-tree-based method [3]. Considering the diverse 
applications in digital library and Web environments, we have 
adopted the second approach. Our proposed term extraction 
method, i.e., the PAT-tree-based local maxima method, is a hybrid 
of the local maxima method [19] and the PAT-tree-based method 
[3], which has been found more efficient and effective. First, we 
construct a PAT tree data structure for the corpus, in this case, a 
set of search-result pages retrieved using the source term as query. 
(The same term extraction method will be applied to extract key 
terms from digital libraries in Section 5 where the corpus is the 
documents in digital libraries). By utilizing the PAT tree, we can 
efficiently calculate the association measurement of every 
character or word n-gram in the corpus and apply the local 
maxima algorithm to extract the terms. The association 
measurement is determined not only by the symmetric conditional 
probability [19] but also by the context independency ratio [3] of 
the  n-gram. We detail the proposed method in the following 
subsections.
3.1

Association Measurement
The proposed association measurement, called SCPCD, combines 
the symmetric conditional probability (SCP) [19] with the concept 
of context dependency (CD) [3]. SCP is the association estimation 
of the correlation between its composed sub n-grams, which is as 
defined below:

) is the
probability of the occurrence of the n-gram  w

w
n
, and
freq(w

n
) is the frequency of the n-gram.
To a certain degree, SCP  can measure the cohesion holding the 
words together within a word n-gram, but it cannot determine the 
lexical boundaries of the n-gram. An n-gram with complete 
lexical boundaries implies that it tends to have free association 
with other n-grams appearing in the same context. Therefore, to 
further ensure that an n-gram has complete lexical boundaries, the 
concept of context dependency is introduced. Moreover, we 
consolidate the concept with SCP to form one association 
measurement. In order to achieve this goal, a refined measure, the 
context independency ratio - which is a ratio value between 0 and 
1 - is extended from [3]. It is defined as follows:

n
) is the number of unique left adjacent words in
western languages, or characters in oriental languages, for the 
n-gram in the corpus, or is equal to the frequency of the n-gram if 
there is no left adjacent word/character. Similarly, RC(w
1
...
w
n
) is
the number of unique right adjacent words/characters for the 
n-gram, or is equal to the frequency of the n-gram if there is no 
right adjacent word/character. Using this ratio we are able to judge 
whether the appearance of an n-gram is dependent on a certain 
string containing it. For example, if w
1
...
w
n
is always a substring
of string xw
1
...
w
n
y in the corpus, then CD(w
1
...
w
n
) is close to 0.
Combining formulae (1) and (2), the proposed association 
measure SCPCD is as follows

Note that the difference between the formulae of SCPCD and SCP 
is in their numerator items. For SCP, those n-grams with low 
frequency tend to be discarded, which is prevented in the case of 
SCPCD. The proposed new measure determines a highly cohesive 
term because of the frequencies of its substrings and the number 
of its unique left and right adjacent words/characters.
3.2

Local Maxima Algorithm
The local maxima algorithm, called LocalMaxs in [18], is based 
on the idea that each n-gram has a kind of cohesion that holds the 
words together within the n-gram. This is a heuristic algorithm 
used to combine with the previous association measurements to 
extract n-grams, which are supposed to be key terms from the text. 
We know different n-grams usually have different cohesion values. 
Given that:
·

An  antecedent (in size)  of  the  n-gram  w
1
w
2
...
w
n
,
ant(w
1
...
w
n
),  is  a  sub-n-gram of the n-gram  w
1
...
w
n
, having
size n - 1. i.e., the (n-1)-gram w
1
...
w
n-1
or w
2
...
w
n
.
·

A successor (in size) of the n-gram w
1
w
2
...
w
n
, succ(w
1
...
w
n
),
is a (n+1)-gram N such that the n-gram w
1
...
w
n
is an ant(N).
i.e.,  succ(w
1
...
w
n
)  contains the n-gram  w
1
...
w
n
and an
additional word before (on the left) or after (on the right) it.
The local maxima algorithm extracts each term whose cohesion, 
i.e. association measure, is local maxima. That is, the term whose 
association measure is greater than, or equal to, the association 
measures of its antecedents and is greater than the association 
measures of its successors.
3.3

The PAT-Tree Based Local Maxima 
Algorithm
Despite the usefulness of the local maxima algorithm, without a 
suitable data structure the time complexity of the algorithm is high. 
The main time complexity problems occur in two areas. One is 
calculating the context independency ratio (CD) for each unique 
n-gram in the corpus and the other is to find the successor of an 
n-gram. The two problems can be treated as one, i.e. finding the 
successors of an n-gram. An intuitive way to do this is to find out 
all  (n+1)-grams and then compare the n-gram with them 
sequentially to see if they are the successors of it. As this is 
time-consuming, we introduce PAT tree as the data structure.
110
The above method is time consuming, however, so we use the 
PAT tree, which is a more efficient data structure. It was 
developed by Gonnet [8] from Morrison's PATRICIA algorithm 
(Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in 
Alphanumeric) [15] for indexing a continuous data stream and 
locating every possible position of a prefix in the stream. The 
PAT tree structure is conceptually equivalent to a compressed 
digital search tree, but smaller. The superior feature of this 
structure mostly resulted from its use of semi-infinite strings [14] 
to store the substream values in the nodes of the tree. This also 
makes it easier and more efficient to find the successors of an 
n-gram. More details on the PAT tree can be found in [3].
By utilizing the constructed PAT tree as the corpus, we can 
efficiently retrieve all n-grams from the corpus, obtain their 
frequencies and context dependency values, and then calculate the 
association measures, SCPCD, of all of them.
3.4

Experiments on Term Extraction
To determine the effectiveness of the proposed association 
measure SCPCD and the efficiency of the PAT-tree data structure, 
we conducted several experiments on Web search-result pages 
using the proposed PAT-tree-based local maxima algorithm.
First, to test whether SCPCD can perform better than SCP and CD, 
we randomly selected 50 real queries in English from a Chinese 
search engine called Openfind
3
. We then submitted each of them
to Google to search Chinese result pages. Most of these query 
terms such as proper nouns and technical terms were not covered 
in the common translation dictionary. After using the term 
extraction method, the top 30 extracted

Chinese translation
candidates were examined and the extraction accuracy of each 
candidate to the source query was manually determined. We 
applied this test mainly to determine whether the SCPCD 
measurement can extract more relevant translation candidates and 
segment them with correct lexical boundaries. A translation 
candidate was taken as correctly extracted only if it was correctly 
segmented and contained meanings relevant to the source term. A 
relevant translation candidate was not necessarily a correct 
translation. The whole relevant set was determined by examining 
the terms extracted by all of the test methods, e.g., CD, SCP, and 
SCPCD. Table 1 clearly shows that the method based on the 
SCPCD measurement achieves the best performance.

recall, and average recall-precision of auto-extracted

In order to determine the efficiency of the PAT-tree data structure, 
we compared the speed performance of the local maxima method 
and the PAT-tree-based local maxima method. As Table 2 shows, 
the PAT-tree data structure is more efficient in term extraction. 
Although the PAT-tree construction phase took a little more time

in a small corpus, in a real-world case for a large corpus - where 
1,367 and 5,357 scientific documents were tested (refer to Section 
5.2 for the details)

- the PAT-tree-based local maxima method
performed much better than the local maxima method.

TERM TRANSLATION
In the term translation module, we utilize the co-occurrence 
relation and the context information between source queries and 
target translations to estimate their semantic similarity and 
determine the most promising translations. Several similarity 
estimation methods were investigated based on co-occurrence 
analysis. These included mutual information, DICE coefficient, 
and statistical tests including the chi-square test and the 
log-likelihood ratio test [17, 20], where the chi-square test and the 
context vector analysis achieved the best performance. These will 
be introduced below.
4.1

The Chi-Square Test
The chi-square test (
2
) was adopted as the major method of
co-occurrence analysis in our study. One major reason is that the 
required parameters for the chi-square test can be effectively 
computed using the search-result pages, which alleviates the data 
sparseness problem. It also makes good use of all relations of 
co-occurrence between the source and target terms, especially the 
information that they do not co-occur. For source term s and target 
term t, the conventional chi-square test can be transformed as the 
similarity measure defined below [6]:

c: the number of pages containing term t but not s; 
d: the number of pages containing neither term s nor t; 
N: the total number of pages, i.e., N= a+b+c+d.
Since most search engines accept Boolean queries and can report 
the number of pages matched, the required parameters for the 
chi-square test can be obtained by submitting Boolean queries 
such as `st', `~st', `s~t' to search engines and utilizing the 
returned page counts. On the other hand, it is easy to get number 
N using some search engines (e.g., Google), which indicates the
111
total number of their collected Web pages. The number d may not 
be directly available from the search engine, but it can be 
calculated using the formula N= a+b+c+d, i.e., d = N-a-b-c.
4.2

Context Vector Analysis
Co-occurrence analysis is applicable to higher frequency terms 
since they are more likely to appear with their translation 
candidates.    On the other hand, lower frequency terms have little 
chance of appearing with candidates on the same pages.  The 
context vector method (CV) is therefore adopted to deal with this 
problem. As translation equivalents may share similar terms, for 
each query term, we take the co-occurring feature terms as the 
feature vector.  The similarity between query terms and 
translation candidates can be computed based on their feature 
vectors.  Thus, lower frequency query terms still have a chance 
to extract correct translations.
The context vector-based method has been used to extract 
translations from comparable corpora, such as the use of Fung et 
al.'s seed word [5]. In our method, real users' popular query terms 
are used as the feature set, which should help to avoid many 
inappropriate feature terms. Like Fung et al.'s vector space model, 
we also use the TF-IDF weighting scheme to estimate the 
significance of context features. This is defined as follows:

engines, and n is the number of pages containing t

. Given the
context vectors of a source query term and each target translation 
candidate, their similarity is estimated with cosine measure as 
follows:

It is not difficult to construct context vectors for source query 
terms and their translation candidates. For a source query term, we 
can use a fixed number of the top search results to extract 
translation candidates. The co-occurring feature terms of each 
query can also be extracted, and their weights calculated, which 
together form the context vector of the query. The same procedure 
is used to construct a context vector for each translation candidate.
4.3

The Combined Method
Benefiting from real-world search engines, the search-result-based 
method using the chi-square test can reduce the work of corpus 
collection, but has difficulty in dealing with low-frequency query 
terms. Although context vector analysis can deal with difficulties 
encountered by the chi-square test, it is not difficult to see that the 
feature selection issue needs to be carefully handled. Intuitively, a 
more complete solution is to integrate the above two methods. 
Considering the various ranges of similarity values in the two 
methods, we use a linear combination weighting scheme to 
compute the similarity measure as follows:

candidate t with respect to source term s - is assigned to be from 1

measure S

(s,t).

Experiments on Term Translation
4.4.1

The Test Bed
To determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we 
conducted several experiments to extract translation pairs for 
Chinese and English terms in different domains.
Web Queries:
We collected query terms and the logs from two
real-world Chinese search engines in Taiwan, i.e., Dreamer and 
GAIS. The Dreamer log contained 228,566 unique query terms for 
a period of over 3 months in 1998, while the GAIS log contained 
114,182 unique query terms for a period of two weeks in 1999. 
We prepared two different test query sets based on these logs. The 
first, called the popular-query set, contained a set of 430 frequent 
Chinese queries in the logs. These queries were obtained from the 
Chinese translations of 1,230 English terms out of the most 
popular 9,709 query terms (with frequencies above 10 in both 
logs), which co-occurred with their English counterparts in the 
logs. The popular-query set was further divided into two types: 
type Dic (the terms covered in the dictionary), consisting of about 
36% (156/430) of the test queries and type OOV (out of 
vocabulary; the terms not in the dictionary), consisting of about 
64% (274/430) of the test queries.
The second set, called the random-query set, contained 200 
Chinese query terms, which were randomly selected from the top 
20,000 queries in the Dreamer log, where 165 (about 82.5%) were 
not included in general-purpose translation dictionaries.
Proper Names and Technical Terms:
To further investigate
the translation effectiveness for proper names and technical terms, 
we prepared two other query sets containing 50 scientists' names 
and 50 disease names in English. These were randomly selected 
from the 256 scientists (Science/People) and 664 diseases 
(Health/Diseases and Conditions) in the Yahoo! Directory. It 
should be noted that 76% (38/50) of the scientists' names and 
72% (36/50) of the disease names were not included in the 
general-purpose translation dictionary, which contained 202,974 
entries collected from the Internet.
To evaluate the search-result-based methods, we obtained 
search-result pages of the source query terms by submitting them 
to real-world Chinese search engines, such as Google Chinese and 
Openfind. Basically, we used only the first 100 retrieved results 
(snippets) to extract translation candidates. The context vector of 
each source query and the required parameters (page counts) for 
the chi-square test were also extracted from the retrieved 
search-result pages.
To evaluate the performance of translation extraction, we used the 
average top-n inclusion rate as a metric. For a set of test queries, 
the top-n inclusion rate was defined as the percentage of queries 
whose translations could be found in the first n extracted 
translations. Also, we wished to know if the coverage rate of 
translations, i.e. the percentage of queries whose translations 
could be found in the whole extracted candidate set, was high 
enough in the top search-result pages for real queries.

Performance
Web Queries
We carried out experiments to determine the performance of the 
proposed approach by extracting translations for the 
popular-query set. Tables 3 and 4 show the results in terms of top 
1-5 inclusion rates and coverage rates for Chinese and English 
queries respectively. In this table, "CV", "
2
" and "Combined"
represent the context-vector analysis, the chi-square test, and the 
combined method, respectively. In addition, "Dic", "OOV" and 
"All" represent the terms covered in a dictionary, the terms not in 
a dictionary, and the total test query set, respectively. The 
coverage rates we obtained were promising, which shows that the 
Web contains rich mixed texts in both languages. The 
performance of the English query set was not as good as the 
Chinese query set. The reason for this was that the English queries 
suffered from more noise in Chinese translation candidates since 
the search-result pages in the Chinese Web generally contain
much more Chinese than English content. We also conducted an 
experiment for random queries. As Table 5 shows, the coverage 
rates were encouraging.
Proper Names, Technical Terms and Common Terms
To further determine the effectiveness of the proposed approach in 
dealing with the translation of proper names and technical terms, 
we conducted an experiment on the test sets of scientists' names 
and medical terms using the combined method. As the results in 
Table 6 show, the top-1 inclusion rates for the scientists' and 
disease names were 40% and 44% respectively. Some examples 
of the extracted correct translations are shown in Table 7.
Although the achieved performance for real queries looked 
promising, we wished to know if it was equally effective for 
common terms. We randomly selected 100 common nouns and 
100 common verbs from a general-purpose Chinese dictionary. 
Table 8 shows the results obtained using the combined method. It 
is easy to see that the proposed approach is less reliable in

extracting translations of such common terms. One possible 
reason is that the usages of common terms are diverse on the Web 
and the retrieved search results are not highly relevant. It is 
fortunate that many of these common words can be found in 
general-purpose translation dictionaries.

BILINGUAL LEXICON CONSTRUCTION
To enhance CLIR services in a digital library that only has 
monolingual document collections, the proposed approach can be 
used to construct a domain-specific bilingual lexicon. We take the 
document set in digital libraries into consideration. The document 
set in the target language is first analyzed and possible key terms 
that are representative of the document set are extracted, using the 
proposed term extraction method. These extracted key terms are 
likely to be similar to terms that users may use in real user queries, 
since they are relatively more significant than other terms in the 
documents. The proposed term translation method can then be 
applied to those key terms not included in common translation 
dictionaries to obtain the translation of key terms in the source 
language. Therefore, a bilingual lexicon can then be constructed 
where the mappings between key terms and relevant terms in the 
source and target languages are maintained.
As we have already indicated, the constructed bilingual lexicon 
can benefit CLIR services. For a given source query, the similarity 
with candidate source relevant terms can be calculated using the 
context vector method presented in Section 4. Also, and the 
top-ranked relevant terms can be extracted using the constructed 
bilingual lexicon. After the corresponding translations of relevant 
terms are obtained, relevant documents in the target language can 
be retrieved, using these relevant translations. The source query
can then be expanded with the relevant translations and 
conventional CLIR methods can be used to retrieve documents in 
the target language.

An Application
We tested the STICNET Database
4
, which is a government-supported
Web-accessible digital library system providing a 
search service for scientific documents collected in Taiwan. The 
system contained documents in either English or Chinese, but no 
cross-language search was provided. To test the performance of 
bilingual lexicon construction, we selected 1,367 Information 
Engineering documents and 5,357 Medical documents 
respectively from the STICNET Database for the period 1983 to 
1997 as the test bed. Using the PAT-tree-based term extraction 
method, key terms were automatically extracted from each 
document collection and their relevant translations were extracted 
by the proposed term translation approach.
In the collection of Information Engineering documents, 1,330 
key terms (with a threshold of 2 to 6-gram character strings, a 
term frequency&gt;10, and an association value&gt;0.1) were 
automatically extracted. Meanwhile, 5,708 key terms (with a 
threshold of 2 to 6-gram character strings and a term 
frequency&gt;40) were automatically extracted from the Medical 
document collection. Among the 1,330 auto-extracted key terms 
from the Information Engineering documents, 32% were not 
included in KUH Chinese Dictionary
5
(unknown terms) - one of
the largest Chinese dictionaries with 158,239 term entries - where 
75% of these unknown terms were found useful. In the case of 
Medical documents, 71% of the 5,708 auto-extracted key terms 
were not included in KUH Chinese Dictionary where 36.6% of 
these unknown terms were found useful. Table 9 shows the 
accuracy of the extracted translations for these useful unknown 
terms. The promising result shows the potential of the proposed 
approach to assist bilingual lexicon construction.

RELATED WORK
Many effective retrieval models have been developed for CLIR. 
For example, the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) method [4] has 
been utilized to model inter-term relationships, instead of exact 
term matching. Other methods include the cross-lingual relevance 
model [11], which integrates popular techniques of 
disambiguation and query expansion. However, translation of 
queries not covered in a bilingual dictionary remains one of the 
major challenges in practical CLIR services [9].
To deal with the translation of out-of-dictionary terms, 
conventional research on machine translation has generally used 
statistical techniques to automatically extract translations from 
domain-specific, sentence-aligned parallel bilingual corpora [20]. 
However, a large parallel corpus is difficult to obtain. Some work 
has been done on term translation extraction from comparable 
texts, such as bilingual newspapers [5], which are easier to obtain. 
Using a non-parallel corpus is more difficult than a parallel one, 
due to the lack of alignment correspondence for sentence pairs. 
On the other hand, research on digital libraries has made the same 
endeavor. Larson et al. [10] proposed a method for translingual 
vocabulary mapping using multilingual subject headings of book 
titles in online library catalogs - a kind of parallel corpus. 
However, book titles are still limited in coverage, compared to the 
rich resources on the Web.
A new potential research direction is to perform query translation 
directly, through mining the Web's multilingual and wide-range 
resources [16]. Web mining is a new research area that focuses on 
finding useful information from large amounts of semi-structured 
hypertexts and unstructured texts [1]. Chen et al. [2] proposed a 
dictionary-based approach in which the search results returned 
from Yahoo China search engine were utilized to extract 
translations for terms not covered in the dictionary. In their work 
only an English term appearing (maybe in parenthesis) 
immediately or closely after a Chinese term was considered a 
possible translation. In our previous research, we proposed an 
approach for extracting translations of Web queries through the 
mining of anchor texts and link structures and obtained very 
promising results [12, 13]. Previous experiments showed that the 
anchor-text-based approach can achieve a good precision rate for 
popular queries. Its major drawback is the very high cost of the 
hardware and software required to collect sufficient anchor texts 
from Web pages. Collecting anchor texts requires a powerful Web 
spider and takes cost of network bandwidth and storage. Because 
of the practical needs of digital libraries, search-result pages, 
which are easier to obtain are, therefore, investigated in this paper.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have introduced a Web-based approach for 
dealing with the translation of unknown query terms for 
cross-language information retrieval in digital libraries. With the 
proposed term extraction and translation methods, it is feasible to
translate unknown terms and construct a bilingual lexicon for key 
terms extracted from documents in a digital library. With the help 
of such bilingual lexicons, it would be convenient for users to 
formulate cross-lingual queries. The simplicity of the approach 
not only makes it very suitable for digital library systems, but 
would also facilitate the implementation of CLIR services.
