Query Result Ranking over E-commerce Web Databases
ABSTRACT
To deal with the problem of too many results returned from an E-commerce
Web database in response to a user query, this paper 
proposes a novel approach to rank the query results. Based on the 
user query, we speculate how much the user cares about each 
attribute and assign a corresponding weight to it. Then, for each 
tuple in the query result, each attribute value is assigned a score 
according to its "desirableness" to the user. These attribute value 
scores are combined according to the attribute weights to get a final 
ranking score for each tuple. Tuples with the top ranking scores are 
presented to the user first. Our ranking method is domain 
independent and requires no user feedback. Experimental results 
demonstrate that this ranking method can effectively capture a 
user's preferences.

INTRODUCTION
With the rapid expansion of the World Wide Web, more and more 
Web databases are available. At the same time, the size of existing 
Web databases is growing rapidly. One common problem faced by 
Web users is that there is usually too many query results returned 
for a submitted query. For example, when a user submits a query to 
autos.yahoo.com to search for a used car within 50 miles of New 
York with a price between $5,000 and $10,000, 10,483 records are 
returned. In order to find "the best deal", the user has to go through 
this long list and compare the cars to each other, which is a tedious 
and time-consuming task.
Most Web databases rank their query results in ascending or 
descending order according to a single attribute (e.g., sorted by date, 
sorted by price, etc.). However, many users probably consider
multiple attributes simultaneously when judging the relevance or 
desirableness of a result. While some extensions to SQL allow the 
user to specify attribute weights according to their importance to 
him/her [21], [26], this approach is cumbersome and most likely 
hard to do for most users since they have no clear idea how to set 
appropriate weights for different attributes. Furthermore, the user-setting
-weight approach is not applicable for categorical attributes.
In this paper, we tackle the many-query-result problem for Web 
databases by proposing an automatic ranking method, QRRE 
(Query Result Ranking for E-commerce), which can rank the query 
results from an E-commerce Web database without any user 
feedback. We focus specifically on E-commerce Web databases 
because they comprise a large part of today's online databases. In 
addition, most E-commerce customers are ordinary users who may 
not know how to precisely express their interests by formulating 
database queries. The carDB Web database is used in the following 
examples to illustrate the intuitions on which QRRE is based.
Example 1:  Consider a used Car-selling Web database D with a 
single table carDB in which the car instances are stored as tuples 
with attributes: Make, Model, Year, Price, Mileage and Location. 
Each tuple t
i
in D represents a used car for sale.
Given a tuple t
i
in the query result T
q
for a query q that is submitted
by a buyer, we assign a ranking score to t
i
, based on its attribute
values, which indicates its desirableness, from an E-commerce 
viewpoint, to the buyer. For instance, it is obvious that a luxury, 
new and cheap car is globally popular and desired in the used car 
market. However, sometimes the desired attribute values conflict 
with each other. For example, a new luxury car with low mileage is 
unlikely to be cheap. Hence, we need to decide which attributes are 
more important for a buyer. Some buyer may care more about the 
model of a car, while some other buyer may be more concerned 
about its price. For each attribute, we use a weight to denote its 
importance to the user.
In this work, we assume that the attributes about which a user cares 
most are present in the query he/she submits, from which the 
attribute importance can be inferred. We define specified attributes 
to be attributes that are specified in a query and unspecified 
attributes to be attributes that are not specified in a query. 
Furthermore, we also consider that a subset of the unspecified 
attributes, namely, those attributes that are closely correlated to the 
query, is also important.
Example 2: Given a query with condition "Year &gt; 2005", the query 
condition suggests that the user wants a relatively new car. 
Intuitively, besides the Year attribute, the user is more concerned 
about the Mileage than he/she is concerned about the Make and 
Location, considering that a relatively new car usually has low 
mileage.

Given an unspecified attribute A
i
, the correlation between A
i
and the
user query q is evaluated by the difference between the distribution 
of A
i
's values over the query results and their distribution over the
whole database D. The bigger the difference, the more A
i
correlates
to the specified attribute value(s). Consequently, we assign a bigger 
attribute weight to A
i
. Example 3 explains our intuition.
Example 3: Suppose a used car database D contains car instances 
for which the Year has values 1975 and onwards and D returns a 
subset d containing the tuples that satisfy the query with condition 
"Year &gt; 2005". Intuitively, Mileage values of the tuples in d 
distribute in a small and dense range with a relatively low average, 
while the Mileage values of tuples in D distribute in a large range 
with a relatively high average. The distribution difference shows a 
close correlation between the unspecified attribute, namely, 
Mileage, and the query "Year &gt; 2005".
Besides the attribute weight, we also assign a preference score to 
each attribute value, including the values of both specified and 
unspecified attributes. In the E-commerce context, we first assume 
that an expensive product is less preferred than a cheap product if 
other attribute values are equal. Hence, we assign a small preference 
score for a high Price value and a large preference score for a low 
Price value. We further assume that a non-Price attribute value with 
high desirableness, such as a luxury car or a new car, correlates 
positively with a high Price value. Thus, a luxury car is more 
expensive than a standard car and a new car is usually more 
expensive than an old car. Based on this assumption, we convert a 
value a
i
of a non-Price attribute A
i
to a Price value p'
I
where p'
I
is
the average price of the product for A
i
= a
i
in the database.
Consequently, the preference score for a
i
will be large if p'
I
is large
because a large Price value denotes a high desirableness for the user. 
Finally, the attribute weight and the value preference score are 
combined to get the final ranking score for each tuple. The tuples 
with the largest ranking scores are presented to the user first. 
The contributions of this paper include the following: 
1.  We present a novel approach to rank the tuples in the query
results returned by E-commerce Web databases.
2.  We propose a new attribute importance learning approach,
which is domain independent and query adaptive.
3.  We also propose a new attribute-value preference score
assignment approach for E-commerce Web databases.
In the entire ranking process, no user feedback is required. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews 
some related work. Section 3 gives a formal definition of the many-query
-result problem and presents an overview of QRRE. Section 4 
proposes our attribute importance learning approach while Section 5 
presents our attribute preference score assignment approach. 
Experimental results are reported in Section 6. The paper is 
concluded in Section 7.
RELATED WORK
Query result ranking has been investigated in information retrieval 
for a long time. Cosine Similarity with TF-IDF weighting of the 
vector space model [2] and [26], the probabilistic ranking model 
[30] and [31] and the statistical language model [12] have been 
successfully used for ranking purposes. In addition, [10], [11], [14]
and [15] explore the integration of database and information 
retrieval techniques to rank tuples with text attributes. [1], [5] and 
[17] propose some keyword-query based retrieval techniques for 
databases. However, most of these techniques focus on text 
attributes and it is very difficult to apply these techniques to rank 
tuples with categorical or numerical attributes.
Some recent research addresses the problem of relational query 
result ranking. In [9], [26], [28] and [33], user relevance feedback is 
employed to learn the similarity between a result record and the 
query, which is used to rank the query results in relational 
multimedia databases. In [21] and [26], the SQL query language is 
extended to allow the user to specify the ranking function according 
to their preference for the attributes. In [18] and [19], users are 
required to build profiles so that the query result is ranked according 
to their profile. Compared with the above work, our approach is 
fully automatic and does not require user feedback or other human 
involvement.
In [1] and [12], two ranking methods have been proposed that take 
advantage of the links (i.e., associations) among records, such as the 
citation information between papers. Unfortunately, linking 
information among records does not exist for most domains.
The work that is most similar to ours is the probabilistic information 
retrieval (PIR) model in [8], which addresses the many-query-result 
problem in a probabilistic framework. In PIR, the ranking score is 
composed of two factors: global score, which captures the global 
importance of unspecified values, and conditional score, which 
captures the strength of the dependencies between specified and 
unspecified attribute values. The two scores are combined using a 
probabilistic approach. Our approach differs from that in [8] in the 
following aspects: 
1.  PIR only focuses on point queries, such as "A
i
= a
i
". Hence, both
a query with condition "Mileage &lt; 5000" and a query with 
condition "Mileage &lt; 2500" may have to be converted to a 
query with condition "Mileage = small" to be a valid query in 
PIR, which is not reasonable for many cases. In contrast, QRRE 
can handle both point and range queries.
2.  PIR focuses on the unspecified attributes during query result
ranking while QRRE deals with both specified and unspecified 
attributes. For example, suppose a car with price less than 
$10,000 is labeled as a "cheap" car. For a query "Price &lt; 10000", 
PIR will only consider the value difference for non-Price 
attributes among tuples and ignore the price difference, which is 
usually important for a poor buyer. On the contrary, QRRE will 
consider the value difference for all attributes.
3.  A workload containing past user queries is required by PIR in
order to learn the dependency between the specified and 
unspecified attribute values, which is unavailable for new online 
databases, while QRRE does not require such a workload.
The experimental results in Section 6 show that QRRE produces a 
better quality ranking than does PIR.
The attribute-importance learning problem was studied in [23] and 
[24], in which attribute importance is learned according to the 
attribute dependencies. In [23], a Bayesian network is built to 
discover the dependencies among attributes. The root attribute is the 
most important while the leaf attributes are less important.
576
In [24], an attribute dependency graph is built to discover the 
attribute dependencies. Both of these methods learn the attribute 
importance based on some pre-extracted data and their result is 
invariant to the user queries. Furthermore, both methods can only 
determine the attribute importance sequence. They are incapable of 
giving a specific value to show how important each attribute is. In 
contrast, the attribute-importance learning method presented in this 
paper can be adapted to the user's query and thus can be tailored to 
take into account the desire of different users, since each attribute is 
assigned a weight that denotes its importance for the user. To our 
knowledge, this is the first work that generates attribute weights that 
are adaptive to the query the user submitted.

QUERY RESULT RANKING
In this section, we first define the many-query-result problem and 
then present an overview of QRRE.
3.1  Problem Formulation
Consider an autonomous Web database D with attributes A={A
1
, A
2
,
..., A
m
} and a selection query q over D with a conjunctive selection
condition that may include point queries, such as "A
i
= a
i
", or range
queries, such as  "a
i1
&lt; A
i
&lt; a
i2
". Let T={t
1
, t
2
, ..., t
n
} be the set of
result tuples returned by D for the query q. In many cases, if q is not 
a selective query, it will produce a large number of query results 
(i.e., a large T). The goal is to develop a ranking function to rank the 
tuples in T that captures the user's preference, is domain-independent
and does not require any user feedback.
3.2  QRRE
Initially, we focus on E-commerce Web databases because E-commerce
Web databases comprise a large proportion of the 
databases on the Web. We further assume that each E-commerce 
Web database has a Price attribute, which we always assume to be 
A
1
. The Price attribute A
1
plays an intermediate role for all attributes
during the attribute preference score assignment.
Example 4:  Consider the tuples in Table 1 that represent an 
example query result set T. It can be seen that most tuples have their 
own advantages when compared with other tuples. For example, t
1

is a relatively new car while t
2
is a luxury car and t
3
is the cheapest
among all cars. Hence, depending on a user's preferences, different 
rankings may be needed for different users. Assuming that a user 
would prefer to pay the smallest amount for a car and that all other 
attribute values are equal, then the only certainty is that t
4
should
always be ranked after t
3
because its mileage is higher than t
3
while
it is more expensive than t
3
.

According to Example 4, two problems need to be solved when we 
assign a ranking score for a tuple t
i
={t
i1
,  t
i2
, ...,  t
im
} in the query
result T: 
1.  How can we surmise how much a user cares about an attribute
A
j
and how should we assign a suitable weight w
j
for the
attribute(s) A
j
to reflect its (their) importance to the user?
2.  How do we assign a preference score v
ij
for an attribute value t
ij
?
For example, when assigning the score for the attribute value "Year 
= 2005" in t
1
, should the score be larger than the score assigned for
attribute value "Year = 2002" in t
2
and how much larger is
reasonable? The first problem will be discussed in Section 4. The 
second problem will be discussed in Section 5.
Having assigned a preference score v
ij
(1jm) to each attribute-value
of t
i
and a weight w
j
to the attribute A
j
, the value preference
scores v
ij
are summed to obtain the ranking score s
i
for t
i
to reflect
the attribute importance for the user. That is:

The overall architecture of a system employing QRRE is shown in 
Figure 1. Such a system includes two components: pre-processing 
component and online processing component. The pre-processing 
component collects statistics about the Web database D using a set

Figure 1: Architecture of a system employing Query Result Ranking for E-commerce (QRRE).
577
of selected queries. Two kinds of histograms are built in the preprocessing
step: single-attribute histograms and bi-attribute 
histograms. A single-attribute histogram is built for each attribute A
j
.
A bi-attribute histogram is built for each non-Price attribute (i.e., A
j

in which i&gt;1) using the Price attribute A
1
.
The online-processing component ranks the query results given the 
user query q. After getting the query results T from the Web 
database  D for q, a weight is assigned for each attribute by 
comparing its data distribution in D and in the query results T. At 
the same time, the preference score for each attribute value in the 
query result is determined using the information from the bi-attribute
histograms. The attribute weights and preference scores are 
combined to calculate the ranking score for each tuple in the query 
result. The tuples' ranking scores are sorted and the top K tuples 
with the largest ranking scores are presented to the user first.
ATTRIBUTE WEIGHT ASSIGNMENT
In the real world, different users have different preferences. Some 
people prefer luxury cars while some people care more about price 
than anything else. Hence, we need to surmise the user's preference 
when we make recommendations to the user as shown by Example 
4 in Section 3. The difficulty of this problem lies in trying to 
determine what a user`s preference is (i.e., which attributes are more 
important) when no user feedback is provided. To address this 
problem, we start from the query the user submitted. We assume 
that the user's preference is reflected in the submitted query and, 
hence, we use the query as a hint for assigning weights to attributes. 
The following example provides the intuition for our attribute 
weight assignment approach.
Example 5:  Consider the query q with condition "Year &gt; 2005", 
which denotes that the user prefers a relatively new car. It is 
obvious that the specified attribute Year is important for the user.  
However, all the tuples in the query result T satisfy the query 
condition. Hence, we need to look beyond the specified attribute and 
speculate further about what the user's preferences may be from the 
specified attribute. Since the user is interested in cars that are made 
after 2005, we may speculate that the user cares about the Mileage 
of the car. Considering the distribution of Mileage values in the 
database, cars whose model year is greater than 2005 usually have 
a lower mileage when compared to all other cars. In contrast, 
attribute Location is less important for the user and its distribution 
in cars whose model year is greater than 2005 may be similar to the 
distribution in the entire database.
According to this intuition, an attribute A
j
that correlates closely
with the query will be assigned a large weight and vice verse. 
Furthermore, as Example 3 in Section 1 shows, the correlation of A
j

and the query can be measured by the data distribution difference of 
A
j
in D and in T.
It should be noted that the specified attribute is not always important, 
especially when the condition for the specified attribute is not 
selective. For example, for a query with condition "Year &gt; 1995 and 
Make = BMW", the specified attribute Year is not important 
because almost all tuples in the database satisfy the condition 
"Year &gt; 1995" and the Year distribution in D and in T is similar.
A natural measure of the distribution difference of A
j
in D and in T
is the Kullback-Leibler distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) 
divergence [13]. Suppose that A
j
is a categorical attribute with value
set {a
j1
, a
j2
, ..., a
jk
}. Then the KL-divergence of A
j
from D to T is:

and prob(A

| T) refers to the probability that A

in T. If A
j
is
a numerical attribute, its value range is first discretized into a few 
value sets, where each set refers to a category, and then the KL-divergence
of A
j
is calculated as in (1).
4.1  Histogram Construction
To calculate the KL-divergence in equation (1) we need to obtain 
the distribution of attribute values over D. The difficulty here is that 
we are dealing with an autonomous database and we do not have 
full access to all the data. In [24], the attribute value distribution 
over a collection of data crawled from D is used to estimate the 
actual attribute value distribution over D. However, it is highly 
likely that the distribution of the crawled data can be different from 
that of D because the crawled data may be biased to the submitted 
queries. 
In this paper, we propose a probing-and-count based method to 
build a histogram for an attribute over a Web database
1
. We assume
that the number of query results is available in D for a given query. 
After submitting a set of selected queries to D, we can extract the 
number of query results, instead of the actual query results, to get 
the attribute value distribution of A
i
. An equi-depth histogram [27] is
used to represent the attribute value distribution, from which we will 
get the probability required in Equation (1). The key problem in our 
histogram construction for A
i
is how to generate a set of suitable
queries to probe D.
Figure 2 shows the algorithm for building a histogram for attribute 
A
i
. For each attribute  A
i
, a histogram is built in the preprocessing
stage. We assume that one attribute value of  A
i
is enough to be a
query for D. If A
i
is a categorical attribute, each category of A
i
is
used as a query to get its occurrence count (Lines 2-3). If A
i
is a
numerical attribute, an equal-depth histogram is built for A
i
. We first
decide the occurrence frequency

threshold  t for each bucket by
dividing |D|, namely, the number of tuples in D, with the minimum 
bucket number n that will be created for a numerical attribute A
i
. In
our experiments, n is empirically set to be 20. Then we probe D 
using a query with condition on A
i
such that low A
i
&lt;up and get c,
the number of instances in that range (Line 8). If c is smaller than t, 
a bucket is added for it in H
Di
(Line 10) and another query probe is
prepared (Line 11). Otherwise, we update the query probe condition 
on  A
i
by reducing the size of the bucket (Line 13) and a new
iteration begins. The iteration continues until each value in the value 
range is in a bucket. It is obvious that there are some improvements 
that can be made to the algorithm to accelerate the histogram 
construction. The improvements are not described here because 
histogram construction is not the major focus of this paper. 
Considering that only a single-attribute histogram is constructed, the 
process should complete quickly.

1
Although both our histogram construction method and the
histogram construction methods in [1] and [5] are probing-based
, they have different goals. The goal in [1] and [5] is to 
build a histogram that precisely describes the regions on which 
the queries concentrate, while our purpose is to build a 
histogram that summarizes the data distribution of D as 
precisely as possible with a number of query probes.
578
A histogram H
Ti
also needs to be built for A
i
over T (the result set) to
get its probability distribution over T. For each bucket of H
Di
, a
bucket with the same bucket boundary is built in H
Ti
while its
frequency is counted in T.
4.2  Attribute Weight Setting
After getting the histogram of A
i
over D and T, the histograms are
converted to a probability distribution by dividing the frequency in 
each bucket of the histogram by the bucket frequency sum of the 
histogram. That is, the probability distribution of A
i
for D, P

The attribute weight assignment is performed not only on the 
unspecified attributes, but also on the specified attributes. If a 
specified attribute is a point condition, its attribute weight will be 
the same for all tuples in the query result. If a specified attribute is a 
range condition, its attribute weight will be different for the tuples in 
the query result. Example 6 illustrates this point.
Example 6: Consider a query q with condition "Make = 2004 and 
Price &lt; 10000". In q, since the specified attribute Make is a point 
attribute, the attribute weight assigned to it is useless because all 
the query results have the same value for Make. On the other hand, 
since the attribute Price is a range attribute, the price of different 
tuples is an important factor to consider during ranking.
4.3  Examples of Attribute Weight Assignment
In our experiments, we found that the attribute weight assignment 
was intuitive and reasonable for the given queries. Table 2 shows 
the attribute weight assigned to different attributes corresponding to 
different queries in our experiments for the carDB. Given a query 
with condition "Mileage &lt; 20000", which means that the user 
prefers a new car, as expected the attribute "Mileage" is assigned a 
large weight because it is a specified attribute and the attribute 
"Year" is assigned a large weight too. The attribute "Model" is 
assigned a large weight because a new car usually has a model that 
appears recently. In contrast, Consider the query with condition 
"Make = BMW & Mileage &lt; 100000".
The
sub-condition
"Mileage &lt; 100000" possesses a very weak selective capability 
because almost all tuples in the database satisfy it. The buyer is 
actually just concerned about the Make and the Model of the car. As 
expected, the attribute Make and Model are assigned large weights, 
while Year and Mileage are no longer assigned large weights.

ATTRIBUTE PREFERENCE SCORE ASSIGNMENT
In addition to the attributes themselves, different values of an 
attribute may have different attractions for the buyer. For example, a 
car with a low price is obviously more attractive than a more 
expensive one if other attribute values are the same. Similarly, a car 
with low mileage is also obviously more desirable. Given an 
attribute value, the goal of the attribute preference score assignment 
module is to assign a preference score to it that reflects its 
desirableness for the buyer. To facilitate the combination of scores 
of different attribute values, all scores assigned for different attribute 
values are in [0, 1].
Instead of requiring human involvement for attribute value 
assignment, given a normal E-commerce context, we make the 
following two intuitive assumptions: 
1.  Price assumption: A product with a lower price is always more
desired by buyers than a product with a higher price if the other 
attributes of the two products have the same values. For 
example, if all other attribute values are the same, a cheaper car 
is preferred over a more expensive car.
2.  Non-Price assumption: A non-Price attribute value with higher
desirableness for the user corresponds to a higher price. For 
example, a new car, which most buyers prefer, is usually more

expensive than an old car. Likewise, a luxury car is usually 
more expensive than an ordinary car.
With the above two assumptions, we divide the attributes into two 
sets: Price attribute set, which only includes the attribute Price, and 
non-Price attribute set, which includes all attributes except Price. 
The two sets of attributes are handled in different ways.
According to the Price assumption, we assign a large score for a low 
price and a small score for a high price. To avoid requiring human 
involvement to assign a suitable score for a Price value, the Price 
distribution in D is used to assign the scores. Given a Price value t, a 
score  v
t
is assigned to it as the percentage of tuples whose Price
value is bigger than t
i
in D:
|
| D
S
v
t
t
=

in which S
t
denotes the number of tuples whose Price value is bigger
than t. In our experiments, the histogram for the attribute Price A
1
,
whose construction method is described in Section 4, is used for the 
Price preference score assignment.
Figure 3 shows the algorithm used to assign a score v for a Price 
value  t using the Price histogram. Given the Price histogram H
D1
,
the frequency sum is fist calculated (Line 1). Then we count the 
number  S
t
of tuples whose Price value is bigger than t. For each
bucket in H
D1
, if the lower boundary of the bucket is bigger than t, it
means that all the tuples for this bucket have a Price value bigger 
than t and the frequency of this bucket is added to S
t
(Line 4). If t is
within the boundary of the bucket, we assume that the Price has a 
uniform distribution in the bucket and a fraction of the frequency in 
this bucket is added to S
t
(Line 5). If the upper boundary of the
bucket is smaller than t, it means that all the tuples for this bucket 
have a Price value lower than t and the bucket is ignored. Finally the 
ratio is generated by dividing S
t
with the frequency sum.
For a value a
i
of a non-Price attribute A
i
, the difficulty of assigning
it a score is two fold:
1.  How to make the attribute preference score assignment adaptive
for different attributes? Our goal is to have an intuitive 
assignment for each attribute without human involvement. The 
difficulty is that different attributes can have totally different 
attribute values.
2.  How to establish the correspondence between different
attributes? For example, how can we know that the
desirableness of "Year = 2005" is the same as the desirableness 
of "Mileage = 5000" for most users?
We solve the problem in two steps. First, based on the non-Price 
assumption, we can convert a non-Price value a
i
to a Price attribute
value t
i
:
·  If A
i
is a categorical attribute, t
i
is the average price for all tuples
in D such that A
i
=a
i
.
·  If A
i
is a numerical attribute, v
i
is the average price for all tuples
in D such that a
i
-d &lt; A
i
&lt; a
i
+d where d is used to prevent too
few tuples or no tuple being collected if we just simply set A
i

=a
i
.
In our experiments, a bi-attribute histogram (A
1
, A
i
) is used when a
i

is converted to a Price value. The bi-attribute histograms are built in 
the pre-processing step in a way similar to the histogram 
construction described in Section 4.
Second, after converting all non-Price attribute values to Price 
values, we use a uniform mechanism to assign them a preference 
score. We assign a large score for a large Price value according to 
the non-Price assumption. That is, given a converted Price value t
i
, a
preference score v
i
is assigned to it as the percentage of Price values
that is smaller than t
i
in D. The algorithm for the converted Price
preference score assignment can be easily adapted from the 
algorithm in Figure 3.
5.1  Examples of Attribute Preference Score
Assignment
Table 3 shows the average Price and assigned score for different 
Make values for the carDB database used in our experiments. It can 
be seen that the prices for different car makes fit our intuition well. 
Luxury cars are evaluated to have a higher price than standard cars 
and, consequently, are assigned a larger preference score. We found 
that the attribute preference assignments for other attributes in 
carDB are intuitive too.

EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we describe our experiments, report the QRRE 
experimental results and compare them with some related work. We 
first introduce the databases we used and the related work for 
comparison. Then we informally give some examples of query 
result ranking to provide some intuition for our experiments. Next, a 
more formal evaluation of the ranking results is presented. Finally, 
the running time statistics are presented.
6.1  Experimental Setup
To evaluate how well different ranking approaches capture a user's 
preference, five postgraduate students were invited to participate in 
the experiments and behave as buyers from the E-commerce 
databases.

6.1.1  Databases
For our evaluation, we set up two databases from two domains in E-commerce
. The first database is a used car database carDB(Make, 
Model, Year, Price, Mileage, Location) containing 100,000 tuples 
extracted from Yahoo! Autos. The attributes Make, Model, Year 
and Location are categorical attributes and the attributes Price and 
Mileage are numerical attributes. The second database is a real 
estate database houseDB(City, Location, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Sq 
Ft, Price) containing 20,000 tuples extracted from Yahoo! Real 
Estate. The attributes City, Location, Bedrooms and Bathrooms are 
categorical attributes and the attributes Sq Ft and Price are 
numerical attributes. To simulate the Web databases for our 
experiments we used MySQL on a P4 3.2-GHz PC with 1GB of 
RAM . We implemented all algorithms in JAVA and connected to 
the RDBMS by DAO.
6.1.2  Implemented Algorithms
Besides QRRE described above, we implemented two other ranking 
methods, which are described briefly below, to compare with 
QRRE. 
RANDOM ranking model: In the RANDOM ranking model, the 
tuples in the query result are presented to the user in a random order. 
The RANDOM model provides a baseline to show how well QRRE 
can capture the user behavior over a random method.
Probabilistic Information Retrieval (PIR) ranking model: A 
probabilistic information retrieval (PIR) technique, which has been 
successfully used in the Information Retrieval field, is used in [8] 
for ranking query results. This technique addresses the same 
problem as does QRRE. In PIR, given a tuple t, its ranking score is 
given by the following equation:




=
Y

(

in which X is the specified attributes, Y is the unspecified attributes, 
W is a past query workload and p denotes the probability.
As mentioned in Section 2, PIR work focuses on point queries 
without considering range queries. Therefore, when applying the 
PIR ranking model, the numerical attributes Price and Mileage in 
carDB and Sq Ft and Price in houseDB are discretized into 
meaningful ranges as categories, which in reality requires a domain 
expert.
In PIR, a workload is required to obtain the conditional probability 
used to measure the correlation between specified attribute values 
present in the query and the unspecified attributes. In our 
experiments, we requested 5 subjects to behave as different kinds of 
buyers, such as rich people, clerks, students, women, etc. and post 
queries against the databases. We collected 200 queries for each 
database and these queries are used as the workload W for the PIR 
model.
6.2  Examples of Query Result Ranking
When we examine the query result rankings, we find that the 
ranking results of both QRRE and PIR are much more reasonable 
and intuitive than that of RANDOM. However, there are some 
interesting examples that show that the QRRE rankings are superior 
to those of PIR. We found that the ranking result of QRRE is more 
reasonable than that of PIR in several ways:
·  QRRE can discover an assumption that is implicitly held by a
buyer. For example, for a query with condition 
"Mileage &lt; 5000".  QRRE  ranks  cars with Year = 2006 as the 
top recommendation. Intuitively, this is because a 2006 model 
year car usually has lower mileage and this is what the user is 
looking for. However, PIR is unable to identify the importance 
of Year because most users assume that Mileage itself is enough 
to represent their preference and, consequently, the relationship 
between Year and Mileage is not reflected in the workload.
·  In PIR, given a numerical attribute, its value range needs to be
discretized into meaningful categories and the values within a 
category are assumed to be the same during ranking. For 
example, if we assign a car with "Mileage &lt; 10000" to be a 
category "Mileage
=
small", then PIR will treat
"Mileage = 2000" to be the same as "Mileage = 9000", which is 
obviously unreasonable. In contrast, QRRE will identify that 
"Mileage = 2000" is more desirable than "Mileage = 9000".
·  QRRE considers the value difference of the specified attributes
of the tuples in the query result, while PIR ignores the difference. 
For example, for a query with condition "Make = Mercedes-Benz
and Model = ML500 and Year &gt; 2003", QRRE usually 
ranks the cars that are made in this year first. However, PIR 
does not take the Year difference in the query result records into 
consideration during ranking.
Likewise, QRRE often produces a ranking better than does PIR for 
houseDB. The actual evaluation in the following section confirms 
these observations.
6.3  Ranking Evaluation
We now present a more formal evaluation of the query result 
ranking quality. A survey is conducted to show how well each 
ranking algorithm captures the user's preference. We evaluate the 
query results in two ways: average precision and user preference 
ranking.
6.3.1  Average Precision
In this experiment, each subject was asked to submit three queries 
for carDB and one query for houseDB according to their preference. 
Each query had on average 2.2 specified attributes for carDB and 
2.4 specified attributes for houseDB. We found that all the attributes 
of carDB and houseDB were specified in the collected queries at 
least once. On average, for carDB, each query had a query result of 
686 tuples, with the maximum being 4,213 tuples and the minimum 
116 tuples. It can be seen that the many-query-result problem is a 
common problem in reality. Each query for houseDB has a query 
result of 166 tuples on average.
Since it is not practical to ask the subjects to rank the whole query 
result for a query, we adopt the following strategy to compare the 
performance of different ranking approaches. For each implemented 
ranking algorithm, we collected the first 10 tuples that it 
recommended. Hence, thirty tuples are collected in total. If there is 
overlap among the recommended tuples from different algorithms, 
we extract more tuples using the RANDOM algorithm so that thirty 
unique tuples are collected in total.

Next, for each of the fifteen
queries, each subject was asked to rank the top 10 tuples as the 
relevant tuples that they preferred most from the thirty unique tuples 
collected for each query. During ranking, they were asked to behave 
like real buyers to rank the records according to their preferences.

We use the Precision/Recall metrics to evaluate how well the user's 
preference is captured by the different ranking algorithms. Precision 
is the ratio obtained by dividing the number of retrieved tuples that 
are relevant by the total number of retrieved tuples. Recall is the 
ratio obtained by dividing the number of relevant tuples by the 
number of tuples that are retrieved. In our experiments, both the 
relevant tuples and the retrieved tuples are 10, which make the 
Precision and Recall to be equal. Table 4 shows the average 
precision of the different ranking methods for each query. It can be 
seen that both QRRE and PIR consistently have a higher precision 
than RANDOM. For 11 queries out of 15, the precision of QRRE is 
higher than that of PIR. The precision of QRRE is equal to that of 
PIR for two queries and is lower than that of PIR for the remaining 
two queries. QRRE's average precision is 0.18 higher than that of 
PIR. QRRE has a precision higher than 0.5 for each query while 
PIR has a precision as low as 0.22 for q3. It should be noted that 
there is some overlap between the top-10 ranked results of QRRE 
and top-10 ranked results of PIR for most queries. Figure 4 and 
Figure 5 show the average precision of the three ranking methods 
graphically for both carDB and houseDB.

6.3.2  User Preference Ranking
In this experiment, 10 queries were collected from the 5 subjects for 
carDB and 5 queries were collected for houseDB. After getting the 
query results, they were ranked using the three ranking methods. 
The ranking results were then provided to the subjects in order to let 
them select which result they liked best.
Table 5 and Table 6 show the user preference ranking (UPR) of the 
different ranking methods for each query for carDB and houseDB, 
respectively. It can be seen that again both QRRE and PIR greatly 
outperform RANDOM. In most cases, the subjects preferred the 
ranking results of QRRE to that of PIR.

While these preliminary experiments indicate that QRRE is 
promising and better than the existing work, a much larger scale 
user study is necessary to conclusively establish this finding.
6.4  Performance Report
Using QRRE, histograms need to be constructed before the query 
results can be ranked. The histogram construction time depends on 
the number of buckets and the time to query the web to get the 
number of occurrences for each bucket. However, in most cases the 
histogram usually does not change very much over time and so 
needs to be constructed only once in a given time period.
The query result ranking in the online processing part includes four 
modules: the attribute weight assignment module, the attribute-value 
preference score assignment module, the ranking score calculation 
module and the ranking score sorting module. Each of the first three 
modules has a time complexity of O(n) after constructing the 
histogram, where n is the number of query results, and the ranking 
score sorting module has a time complexity of O(nlog(n)). Hence, 
the overall time complexity for the online processing stage is 
O(nlog(n)).
Figure 6 shows the online execution time of the queries over carDB 
as a function of the number of tuples in the query result. It can be 
seen that the execution time of QRRE grows almost linearly with 
the number of tuples in the query result. This is because ranking 
score sorting is fairly quick even for a large amount of data and thus 
most of the running time is spent in the first three modules.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, a novel automated ranking approach for the many-query
-result problem in E-commerce is proposed. Starting from the 
user query, we assume that the specified attributes are important for 
the user. We also assume that the attributes that are highly 
correlated with the query also are important to the user. We assign a 
weight for each attribute according to its importance to the user. 
Then, for each value in each tuple of the query result, a preference 
score is assigned according to its desirableness in the E-commerce 
context, where users are assumed to more prefer products with 
lower prices. All preference scores are combined according to the 
attribute weight assigned to each attribute. No domain knowledge or 
user feedback is required in the whole process. Preliminary 
experimental results indicate that QRRE captures the user 
preference fairly well and better than existing works.
We acknowledge the following shortcoming of our approach, which 
will be the focus for our future research. First, we do not deal with
string attributes, such as book titles or the comments for a house, 
contained in many Web databases. It would be extremely useful to 
find a method to incorporate string attributes into QRRE.  Second, 
QRRE has only been evaluated on small-scale datasets. We realize 
that a large, comprehensive benchmark should be built to 
extensively evaluate a query result ranking system, both for QRRE 
and for future research. Finally, QRRE has been specifically tailored 
for E-commerce Web databases. It would be interesting to extend 
QRRE to also deal with non-E-commerce Web databases.
