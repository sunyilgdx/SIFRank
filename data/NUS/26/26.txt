Accelerating 3D Convolution using Graphics Hardware
Abstract
Many volume filtering operations used for image enhancement,
data processing or feature detection can be written in terms of three-dimensional
convolutions. It is not possible to yield interactive
frame rates on todays hardware when applying such convolutions
on volume data using software filter routines. As modern graphics
workstations have the ability to render two-dimensional convoluted
images to the frame buffer, this feature can be used to accelerate
the process significantly. This way generic 3D convolution
can be added as a powerful tool in interactive volume visualization
toolkits.
Introduction
Direct volume rendering is a very important technique for visualizing
three dimensional data. Several fundamental different methods
have been introduced [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12]. Hardware-based volume
texturing [9, 14] is one of the most prominent variants for interactive
visualization due to the high frame rates that can be achieved
with this technique.
The basic principle of texture based volume rendering is depicted
in Figure 1. According to the sampling theorem a 3D view of the
volume is generated by drawing an adequate number of equidistant,
semi-transparent polygons parallel to the image plane with respect
to the current viewing direction ("volume slicing").
Filtering on the other hand is a major part of the visualization
pipeline. It is broadly used for improving images, reducing noise,
and enhancing detail structure. Volume rendering can benefit from
filter operations, as low pass filters reduce the noise e.g. of sam-pled
medical volume images and high pass filters can be used for
edge extraction, visualizing prominent data features. Multiscale approaches
as [13] regularly use disjunct filtering and downsampling
steps and can benefit from any speedups of the filtering process.

Filters can be classified as linear or non-linear. Discrete linear filters
can be written as convolutions with filter kernels that completely
specify the filtering operation. Non-linear filters, as for instance
morphological operators, were recently used for volume analysis
and visualization [7]. Segmentation and classification depend heavily
on filtering operations as well. Bro-Nielson [1] already thought
about using convolution hardware for accelerating the registration
process.
For texture based volume rendering the data set has to be loaded
into special texture memory, which can be addressed by the graphics
pipe very fast. The loading process itself is relatively slow, taking
several seconds for big data sets even on the fastest available
graphics workstations. As the data set has to be reloaded after a
filter operation has been performed in software, interactive filtering
will benefit a lot from convolution algorithms that directly work
on the texture hardware. Additionally, we will show in the following
that computing the convolution with graphics hardware is much
faster than software solutions.

Of course special care has to be taken near the boundaries of the
input data function, as convolution routines are generally written
on a very low language level for speed purposes.
Figure 2 shows two well known convolution filters, the Gauﬂ filter
and its second derivative, both in their continuous and discrete
forms. They can be used for noise reduction and edge detection,
respectively. An example image that was filtered with these kernels
can be seen in Figure 3.
Hardware Acceleration
In order to accelerate the convolution process, special purpose hardware
can be used. On systems that have built-in Digital Signal
Processors (DSPs), for example for multimedia acceleration, a spe-cialized
convolution subroutine could be downloaded to the signal

processor. On the other hand, most times these DSPs are not well
documented or the run-time system can not be modified by the user.
In general they are not faster than the main processor as well. Additionally
, there exists a wide range of different DSP systems, all of
which are incompatible to each other.
The approach we have implemented in our system is to combine
a 2D and a 1D convolution kernel in order to calculate three-dimensional
separable convolutions. Several vendors of the graphics
API OpenGL -- as for example Silicon Graphics Inc. [10] -have
included extensions for one- and two-dimensional filtering.
In contrast to most implementations that emulate these extensions
only in software, the SGI graphics pipes MXE and BasicReality
calculate the convolutions on-board, boosting performance by an
order of magnitude already for reasonably sized filters. The CRM
graphics system of the O
2
is capable of rendering convolutions in
hardware as well, but it does not support volume textures, which
are crucial for the algorithm as well.
Recall that the volume data is already stored in texture memory for
visualization using texture hardware. Now (1) and (2) are combined
to one 2D convolution that is to be applied to every plane of the volume
data perpendicular to the z-axis. Therefore, plane by plane is
drawn by rendering textured triangle strips (two triangles per strip)
into the frame buffer as it is sketched in Figure 4. The texture coordinates
assigned to the vertices of the triangle strips are specified
in such way that no interpolation of the texture is necessary (see
Figure 5). In order to increase the potential speedup and to avoid
rounding problems, nearest neighbor interpolation is activated during
the rendering process. Each plane is then read back with the
OpenGL routine
glCopyTexSubImage3DEXT
, which replaces
one plane of the active volume texture orthogonal to the z-axis by
data that is read directly from the frame buffer. While transfering
the data to the texture memory, the separable 2D convolution filter
is activated using
glSeparableFilter2DEXT
. After this first
pass, the volume texture contains data filtered along the x- and y-axes
.

Applying the convolution to the third axis is more complicated and
depicted in Figure 6. In this second pass planes are rendered perpendicular
to one of the other axes. Assume that the y-axis has been
chosen. As
glCopyTexSubImage3DEXT
can not write planes
orthogonal to any other axis than the z-axis to the texture memory,
they have to be transfered to a second volume texture. OpenGL's
texture objects are used by calling
glBindTexture
for switching
between them, which implies only a very small overhead. While
copying the data from the frame buffer to the texture memory, a
one-dimensional convolution filter is activated. As we are dealing
with two-dimensional image data, we specify a 2D convolution filter
with
glConvolutionFilter2DEXT
, using a filter kernel
that is exactly one pixel wide.
After this second pass the convoluted volume data has been mirrored
at the plane y
- z = 0. For texture based volume renderers
this does not impose any restrictions, as they only have to swap coordinates
during texture coordinate calculations. When data order
is crucial for the application, the algorithm of pass two can be used
for both passes, thus restoring the data order in the second pass.
However, the textured planes have to be drawn two times perpendicular
to the y-axis. Cache misses are much more likely in this
case in respect to planes rendered orthogonal to the z-axis. This
can increase the convolution times on big volumes by up to 50%
even on fast graphics hardware.
Figure 7 depicts the relevant part of the OpenGL pipeline. It reveals
, that pixel fragments read from the frame buffer are clamped
to [0, 1) before they can be written back to the frame buffer or into
the texture memory. Filter kernels with negative coefficients can
compute negative intermediary values during the two-dimensional
convolution pass, which will not contribute to the final 1D convolution
. Additionally, no negative results can be stored in the output
volume. These values are especially needed when the filter kernel
is not symmetrical.
The strategy for avoiding these effects depends on the particular
application. For edge detection the absolute maxima of the filtered
volume data are of interest.
In this case, calculating the
absolute value can be performed in hardware as well, further reducing
necessary computations on the CPU. In most other cases
post-convolution scaling and bias can be used to map the expected
results to the interval [0, 1) just before the clamping takes place.
OpenGL provides the
GL POST CONVOLUTION c SCALE EXT
and
GL POST CONVOLUTION c BIAS EXT
parameters, which
are applied to pixel color values after convolution and before clamping
as depicted in Figure 7.
Results
The used data sets are presented on the color plate. Figures 8 to 12
show slices of a head data set of size 128
3
. Figure 8 reveals the
unfiltered data set, whereas Figure 9 and 10 present slices of the
software and hardware low pass filtered volume data, respectively.
Here, a Gauﬂ filter kernel of size 5
3
has been used. Almost no
differences can be detected. Figure 11 and 12 depict the results
for high pass filtering using the second derivative of the Gauﬂ filter
, again computed in software and in hardware. The hardware
convoluted volume displays noticeable artifacts that occur due to
the already mentioned clamping step in the OpenGL pipeline. By
using post-convolution scaling and bias the artifacts disappear completely
.
The Figures 13 to 18 picture another data set that has been used
for testing the implementation. They have been visualized with the
hardware based volume rendering toolkit TiVOR [11], again with
the first picture being rendered with the original data set. While
the noise reduction effect of the Gauﬂ filter is rather bothering in
Figure 14 by smearing volume details, it has remarkable positive
effects on ISO surface generation (compare Figures 17 and 18).
Please remark that the ISO surfaces are rendered in real-time using
a hardware accelerated volume rendering approach described
in [14].
Noise interferes with high pass filters, which can be seen in Figure
15. Using a high pass filter on the already low pass filtered data
set reveals by far more and better separable details (see Figure 16)
compared to the directly filtered volume.
We have tested the speed our implementation against a well tuned
software convolution filter. Unsurprisingly, the software convolution
is almost completely memory bound. Even extremely fast
workstations as the Octane are limited by the main memory band-473

width, as today's caches are far too small for the values needed
for convolution along the z-axis. High end machines as the Onyx2
perform huge 3D convolutions three times faster than the Octane,
even when equipped with slower CPUs. Standard PCs cannot cope
with the memory bandwidth of the Onyx2 system, and multipro-cessor
options will not accelerate the process because it is not CPU
bound.
Table 1 shows convolution times for different data sets and filter
sizes, using software and hardware convolution. All times have
been measured on an Onyx2 equipped with a BasicReality graphics
pipe. The maximum filter size supported by the graphics system
is 7
2
. Therefor, the maximum 3D convolution that can be performed
in hardware on this system is 7
3
. Noteworthy is the fact
that the BasicReality graphics system is optimized for filter kernels
of size 5
2
. Convolutions with smaller kernels need exactly the same
computation time. Filters of size 6
2
and 7
2
share their timing results
as well. The x and y coordinates of the volume are swapped during
the hardware based convolution process, which is a side effect of
the presented 3D convolution algorithm.
Conclusion
As several of today's graphics workstation vendors have added two-dimensional
convolution to their OpenGL pipeline, using this capability
for accelerating 3D convolution is an almost straightforward
approach. We have determined that by using the implemented
algorithm three-dimensional convolution can be performed even
on big data sets with nearly interactive rates. First promising approaches
of accelerating wavelet decomposition and reconstruction
have been investigated as well [3].
As all intermediary data is transfered to the frame buffer, clamping
can swallow negative values that result from the two-dimensional
convolution as well as final negative results. Thus this approach
is currently most useful for symmetrical filter kernels. By using
post-convolution scaling and bias extensions these problems can be
easily overcome.
Non-separable convolutions are not possible right now with this algorithm
. However, by applying several two-dimensional filter kernels
and blending convoluted images in the frame buffer the use of
non-separable 3D kernels will be a possibility for the future as well.
