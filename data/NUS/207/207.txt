Use of Relative Code Churn Measures to Predict System Defect Density
ABSTRACT
Software  systems  evolve  over  time  due  to  changes  in 
requirements, optimization of code, fixes for security and 
reliability bugs etc. Code churn, which measures the changes 
made to a component over a period of time, quantifies the extent 
of this change.  We present a technique for early prediction of 
system defect density using a set of relative code churn measures 
that relate the amount of churn to other variables such as 
component size and the temporal extent of churn.   
Using statistical regression models, we show that while absolute 
measures of code churn are poor predictors of defect density, our 
set of relative measures of code churn is highly predictive of 
defect density. A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 
indicates the validity of the relative code churn measures as early 
indicators of system defect density. Furthermore, our code churn 
metric suite is able to discriminate between fault and not fault-prone
binaries with an accuracy of 89.0 percent.

INTRODUCTION
A "reliability chasm" often separates the quality of a software 
product observed in its pre-release testing in a software 
development shop and its post-release use in the field.  That is, 
true field reliability, as measured by the number of failures found 
by customers over a period of time, cannot be measured before a
product has been completed and delivered to a customer. Because 
true reliability information is available late in the process, 
corrective actions tend to be expensive [3]. Clearly, software 
organizations can benefit in many ways from an early warning 
system concerning potential post-release defects in their product 
to guide corrective actions to the quality of the software.
We use code churn to predict the defect density in software 
systems. Code churn is a measure of the amount of code change 
taking place within a software unit over time.  It is easily extracted 
from a system's change history, as recorded automatically by a 
version control system. Most version control systems use a file 
comparison utility (such as diff) to automatically estimate how 
many lines were added, deleted and changed by a programmer to 
create a new version of a file from an old version. These 
differences are the basis of churn measures.
We create and validate a set of relative code churn measures as 
early indicators of system defect density. Relative churn measures 
are normalized values of the various measures obtained during the 
churn process. Some of the normalization parameters are total 
lines of code, file churn, file count etc.  Munson et al. [17] use a 
similar relative approach towards establishing a baseline while 
studying code churn. Studies have shown that absolute measures 
like LOC are poor predictors of pre- and post release faults [7] in 
industrial software systems. In general, process measures based on 
change history have been found be better indicators of fault rates 
than product metrics of code [9]. In an evolving system it is highly 
beneficial to use a relative approach to quantify the change in a 
system. As we show, these relative measures can be devised to 
cross check each other so that the metrics do not provide 
conflicting information.
Our basic hypothesis is that code that changes many times pre-release
will likely have more post-release defects than code that 
changes less over the same period of time. More precisely, we 
address the hypotheses shown in Table 1.
Our experiments on Windows Server 2003 (W2k3) support these 
four hypotheses with high statistical significance. We analyzed the 
code churn between the release of W2k3 and the release of the 
W2k3 Service Pack 1 (W2k3-SP1) to predict the defect density in 
W2k3-SP1. The relative code churn measures are statistically 
better predictors of defect density than the absolute measures.

RELATED WORK
Prior analyses on predicting defect density used code churn 
measures as part of a larger set of metrics. Code churn measures 
have not been studied in isolation as predictors of software defect 
density. The background work presented below is from studies 
that involved industrial software systems. The source code base of 
W2k3 is two orders of magnitude larger than the largest example 
considered below.
Munson et al. [17] observe that as a system is developed, the 
relative complexity of each program module that has been altered 
(or churned) also will change. The rate of change in relative 
complexity serves as a good index of the rate of fault injection.  
They studied a 300 KLOC (thousand lines of code) embedded real 
time system with 3700 modules programmed in C. Code churn 
metrics were found to be among the most highly correlated with 
problem reports [17].
Khoshgoftaar et al.[13] define debug churn as the number of lines 
of code added or changed for bug fixes. Their objective was to 
identify modules where debug code churn exceeds a threshold, in 
order to classify the modules as fault-prone. They studied two 
consecutive releases of a large legacy system for 
telecommunications. The system contained over 38,000 
procedures in 171 modules. Discriminant analysis identified fault-prone
modules based on 16 static software product metrics. Their 
model when used on the second release showed a type I and II 
misclassification rate of 21.7%, 19.1% respectively and an overall 
misclassification rate of 21.0%.
Ohlsson et al. [19] identify fault-prone modules by analyzing 
legacy software through successive releases. They use a total of 
28 measures, twelve of which are based on size and change
measures. These measures were used to identify 25 percent of the 
most fault-prone components successfully.
Karunanithi [12] uses a neural network approach for software 
reliability growth modeling in the presence of continuous code 
churn, which he shows improves over the traditional time-domain 
based models. Similarly Khoshgoftaar et al. [15] use code churn 
as a measure of software quality in a program of 225,000 lines of 
assembly language. Using eight complexity measures, including 
code churn, they found neural networks and multiple regression to 
be an efficient predictor of software quality, as measured by gross 
change in the code. They suggest that using neural networks may 
not work in all environments and the results obtained are 
environment specific.  Neural networks can be used for improving 
software maintenance [15].
Ostrand et al. [20] use information of file status such as new, 
changed, unchanged files along with other explanatory variables 
such as lines of code, age, prior faults etc. as predictors in a 
negative binomial regression equation to predict the number of 
faults in a multiple release software system. The predictions made 
using binomial regression model were of a high accuracy for 
faults found in both early and later stages of development. [20]
Closely related to our study is the work performed by Graves et al. 
[9] on predicting fault incidences using software change history. 
Several statistical models were built based on a weighted time 
damp model using the sum of contributions from all changes to a 
module in its history. The most successful model computes the 
fault potential by summing contributions from changes to the 
module, where large and/or recent changes contribute the most to 
fault potential [9]. This is similar to our approach of using relative 
measures to predict fault potential.
Drawing general conclusions from empirical studies in software 
engineering is difficult because any process depends to a large 
degree on a potentially large number of relevant context variables.  
For this reason, we cannot assume a priori that the results of a 
study generalize beyond the specific environment in which it was 
conducted [2].  Researchers become more confident in a theory 
when similar findings emerge in different contexts [2].  Towards 
this end we intend that our case study contributes towards 
strengthening the existing empirical body of knowledge in this 
field [7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20].
DATA COLLECTION
The baseline used for measuring the code churn and other 
measures described below is Windows Server 2003 (W2k3). We 
measured churn between this baseline and Windows Server 2003 
Service Pack 1 (W2k3-SP1). We sometimes refer to W2k3-SP1 as 
the "new version" of the code.  Service packs are a means by 
which product updates are distributed
1
. Service packs contain
updates for system reliability, program compatibility, security, etc. 
that are conveniently bundled for easy downloading.
The size of the code base analyzed is 44.97 million LOC (44,970 
KLOC). This consisted of 2465 binaries which were compiled 
from 96,189 files. Some files contribute to more than one binary. 
As defects for W2k3-SP1 are reported at the binary level, we 
relate churn to defects at the level of binaries.

The absolute measures and methods of data collection are 
described below:
·
Total LOC  is the number of lines of non-commented 
executable lines in the files comprising the new version 
of a binary. Internal Microsoft tools were used to 
compute this measure.
·
Churned LOC  is the sum of the added and changed 
lines of code between a baseline version and a new 
version of the files comprising a binary.
·
Deleted LOC  is the number of lines of code deleted 
between the baseline version and the new version of a 
binary. The churned LOC and the deleted LOC are 
computed by the version control systems using a file 
comparison utility like diff.
·
File count  is the number of files compiled to create a 
binary.
·
Weeks of churn is the cumulative time that a file was 
opened for editing from the version control system.
·
Churn count is the number of changes made to the files 
comprising a binary between the two versions (W2k3 
and W2k3-SP1).
·
Files churned  is the number of files within the binary 
that churned.

RELATIVE CODE CHURN MEASURES
In this section we describe our relative code churn measures. The 
churn measures are denoted by the elements M1-M8. The 
elements and their relationship to defect density are explained 
below (these relationships are verified in section 5.1):
·
M1: Churned LOC / Total LOC. We expect the larger 
the proportion of churned (added + changed) code to the 
LOC of the new binary, the larger the magnitude of the 
defect density for that binary will be.
·
M2: Deleted LOC / Total LOC. We expect the larger 
the proportion of deleted code to the LOC of the new 
binary, the larger the magnitude of the defect density for 
that binary will be.
·
M3: Files churned / File count. We expect the greater 
the proportion of files in a binary that get churned, the 
greater the probability of these files introducing defects. 
For e.g. suppose binaries A and B contain twenty files 
each. If binary A has five churned files and binary B has 
two churned files, we expect binary A to have a higher 
defect density.
·
M4: Churn count / Files churned. Suppose binaries A 
and B have twenty files each and also have five churned 
files each. If the five files in binary A are churned 
twenty times and the five files in binary B are churned 
ten times, then we expect binary A to have a higher 
defect density. M4 acts as a cross check on M3.
·
M5: Weeks of churn / File count.  M5  is  used  to 
account for the temporal extent of churn. A higher value 
of M5 indicates that it took a longer time to fix a smaller
number of files.  This may indicate that the binary 
contains complex files that may be hard to modify 
correctly.  Thus, we expect that an increase in M5 would 
be accompanied by an increase in the defect density of 
the related binary.
·
M6: Lines worked on / Weeks of churn: The measure 
"Lines worked on" is the sum of the churned LOC and 
the deleted LOC. M6 measures the extent of code churn 
over time in order to cross check on M5. Weeks of 
churn does not necessarily indicate the amount of churn. 
M6 reflects our expectation that the more lines are 
worked on, the longer the weeks of churn should be. A 
high value of M6 cross checks on M5 and should 
predict a higher defect density.
·
M7: Churned LOC / Deleted LOC. M7 is used in order 
to quantify new development. All churn is not due to 
bug fixes. In feature development the lines churned is 
much greater than the lines deleted, so a high value of 
M7 indicates new feature development. M7 acts as a 
cross check on M1 and M2, neither of which accurately 
predicts new feature development.
·
M8: Lines worked on / Churn count: We expect that 
the larger a change (lines worked on) relative to the 
number of changes (churn count), the greater the defect 
density will be. M8 acts as a cross check on M3 and 
M4, as well as M5 and M6. With respect to M3 and M4, 
M8 measures the amount of actual change that took 
place. M8 cross checks to account for the fact that files 
are not getting churned repeatedly for small fixes. M8 
also cross checks on M5 and M6 to account for the fact 
that the higher the value of M8 (more lines per churn), 
the higher is the time (M5) and lines worked on per 
week (M6). ). If this is not so then a large amount of 
churn might have been performed in a small amount of 
time, which can cause an increased defect density.
Figure 1 illustrates the cross check relationships of these relative 
code churn measures. As discussed above M1, M2 and M7 cross 
check on each other and M8 cross checks on the set of M3, M4 
and M5, M6. All these measures triangulate on their respective 
dependent measures with the goal of providing the best possible 
estimate of defect density with a minimum inflation in the 
estimation.

CASE STUDY
We now describe the case study performed at Microsoft. Section 
5.1 presents the correlation analysis between the relative code 
churn measures and system defect density. Section 5.2 details the 
model building activities and Section 5.3 the predictive ability of 
the models. Section 5.4 discusses the discriminative power of the 
relative code churn measures and Section 5.5 the limitations of the 
study.

As mentioned before, the system defect density for W2k3-SP1 
was collected at the level of binaries. That is, for each binary we 
have a count of the number of defects assigned to that binary.
Throughout the rest of the paper we assume a statistical 
significance at 99% confidence (level of significance ( = 0.01)).
5.1 Correlation Analysis
Our goal is to verify that with an increase in the code churn 
measures (M1-M8) there is a statistically significant increase in 
the defects/KLOC. Table 2 shows the Spearman rank correlation 
() among the defects/KLOC and the relative code churn 
measures. Spearman rank correlation is a commonly-used robust 
correlation technique [8] because it can be applied even when the 
association between elements is non-linear.
Table 2 shows that there exists a statistically significant (at 99% 
confidence) positive relationship between the measures and the 
defects/KLOC (shown in bold). Thus, with an increase in the 
relative churn measures there is a corresponding positive increase 
in the defects/KLOC. This is indicated by the statistically 
significant positive Spearman rank correlation coefficient . From 
the above observations we conclude that an increase in relative 
code churn measures is accompanied by an increase in system 
defect density (H
1
).
In order to illustrate the cross checks better consider the measures 
M1, M2 and M7 in Figure 2 with their Spearman rank correlation 
coefficients from Table 2.

Figure 2: Cross Correlation Relationships
The Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.834 between M1 and 
M2 indicates that there is a very strong correlation between the 
two measures. But this might not be the case when there is a 
higher proportion of churned code compared to deleted code (as 
measured by M7 for new feature development). Since this cannot 
be measured by M1 or M2, M7 acts as a cross check on them. The 
correlation between M1 and M7 (0.466) indicates when there is a

new feature addition there is a corresponding increase in the 
churned code. For M2 and M7 this correlation is not as strong (but 
is statistically significant) because there were relatively fewer new 
feature additions compared to other changes in the W2k3-SP1 
source base.
5.2 Model Fitting
We now compare predictive models built using absolute measures 
against those built using the relative churn measures. For the 
absolute model, defects/KLOC is the dependent variable and the 
predictors are the absolute measures described in Section 3. For 
the relative model, defects/KLOC is the dependent variable and 
the predictors are the relative measures described in Section 4.
R
2
is a measure of variance in the dependent variable that is
accounted for by the model built using the predictors [4]. R
2
is a
measure of the fit for the given data set. (It cannot be interpreted 
as the quality of the dataset to make future predictions). The 
adjusted R
2
measure also can be used to evaluate how well a
model will fit a given data set [5]. Adjusted R
2
explains for any
bias in the R
2
measure by taking into account the degrees of
freedom of the predictor variables and the sample population. The 
adjusted R
2
tends to remain constant as the R
2
measure for large
population samples.
The multiple regression model fit for absolute measures using all 
the predictors has an R
2
value of 0.052 (F=16.922, p&lt;0.0005).
(The F-ratio is used to test the hypothesis that all regression 
coefficients are zero). This is a poor fit of the data and irrespective 
of other transformations (like for e.g. log) we cannot get a marked 
improvement in R
2
. The adjusted R
2
value for the absolute
measures is 0.49. Throughout the rest of this paper we present the 
adjusted R
2
values in addition to the R
2
measures in order to
eliminate any bias in model building. But with respect to the large 
sample size (2465 binaries) the adjusted R
2
and R
2
value

show
only minor variation, not sufficient enough to drop the R
2
value
and employ the adjusted

R
2
value.


There are different ways in which regression models [16] can be 
built. Three common regression methods [16] are forward, 
backward and step-wise regression. In forward regression, one 
adds a single predictor at a time to the model based on the strength 
of its correlation with the dependent variable. The effect of adding 
each predictor is evaluated based on the results of an F-ratio test 
[16].  Variables that do not significantly add to the success of the 
model are excluded. In backward regression, a model is built 
using all the predictors. The weakest predictor variable is removed 
and the strength of the overall built model is assessed similar to 
the forward regression procedure. If this significantly weakens the 
model then the predictor is put back (and otherwise removed). 
Step-wise regression [16] is the more robust technique of these 
methods. The initial model consists of the predictor having the 
single largest correlation with the dependent variable. 
Subsequently, new predictors are selected for addition into the 
model based on their partial correlation with the predictors already 
in the model. With each new set of predictors, the model is 
evaluated and predictors that do not significantly contribute 
towards statistical significance in terms of the F-ratio are removed 
so that, in the end, the best set of predictors explaining the 
maximum possible variance is left.
A step-wise regression analysis using the absolute set of 
predictors does not lead to any significant change in the R
2
values
(=0.051) (adjusted R
2
= 0.050). Only the LOC and the number of
times a file is churned are kept as predictors. This further confirms 
the fact that using the absolute measures is not an appropriate 
method for assessing the system defect density.
Several empirical studies use Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) [10] to build regression models [6]. In PCA a smaller 
number of uncorrelated linear combinations of metrics, which 
account for as much sample variance as possible, are selected for 
use in regression. PCA is not a possible solution when using 
absolute measures because the correlation matrix is not positive 
definite. We still use the two principal components generated to 
build a multiple regression equation. The multiple regression 
equation constructed has an even lower value of R
2
=0.026,
(F=33.279, p&lt;0.0005).
Based on the three results discussed above (multiple regression 
using all the predictors, step-wise regression and PCA) we 
conclude that the absolute measures are not good predictors of 
system defect density.
As outlined in Section 3 we calculate the relative code churn 
measures (M1-M8) and build regression models using all the 
measures, step-wise regression and PCA. Table 3 shows the R
2

value of the regression equation built using all the measures. We 
also present the adjusted R
2
value and the root MSE (Mean
Squared Error).

Table 4 shows how the R
2
value changes in step-wise regression
for all the models built during that process. In the step-wise 
regression model the measure M7 is dropped. The best R
2
value in
Table 4 (without M7) is the same as that of Table 3 (.811) but 
there is a change in the third decimal place of the standard error of 
the estimate. M7 probably was dropped because there were 
relatively fewer new feature additions compared to other changes 
in the W2k3-SP1 source base. The adjusted R
2
values are also
shown but are not significantly different from the R
2
values due to
the large sample size used to build the models.

The PCA of the eight relative code churn measures yields three 
principal components. PCA can account for the multicollinearity 
among the measures, which can lead to inflated variance in the 
estimation of the defect density.

But for PCA to be applicable the KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) 
measure[11] of sampling adequacy should be greater than 0.6 [4]. 
The KMO measure of sampling adequacy is a test of the amount 
of variance within the data that can be explained by the measures. 
The KMO measure of the eight relative code churn measures is 
0.594 which indicates that PCA might not be an appropriate 
method to apply.
We still perform the analysis to investigate and present those 
results as well on a comparative basis. The results for all three 
models are summarized in Table 5.

explain the system defect density (H

).

5.3 Defect Density Prediction
We use the technique of data splitting [18] to measure the ability 
of the relative code churn measures to predict system defect 
density. The data splitting technique was employed to get an 
independent assessment of how well the defect density can be 
estimated from a population sample. We randomly select two 
thirds of the binaries (1645) to build the prediction model and use 
the remaining one third (820) to verify the prediction accuracy. 
We constructed models using all the measures, step-wise 
regression and PCA (for purpose of completeness). Table 6 shows 
the results for these models.

Using the fitted regression equation we estimate the system defect

constructed using all the measures (sorted by estimated defect 
density). The estimated defect density is shown by the thicker 
continuous line. From the graph we can see that the estimated 
defect density is similar to the actual defect density. The axes on 
the graphs are removed in order to protect proprietary data
To quantify the sensitivity of prediction, we run a correlation 
analysis between the estimated and actual values. A high positive 
correlation coefficient indicates that with an increase in the actual 
defect density there is a corresponding positive increase in the 
estimated defect density. We perform Pearson and Spearman 
correlations to indicate their sensitivity. The Pearson correlation 
indicates a linear relationship. The Spearman correlation is a more 
robust correlation technique.
Table 7 shows that the correlations are all positive and statistically 
significant. The magnitude of the correlations indicates the 
sensitivity of the predictions (the stronger the correlations the 
more sensitive are the predictions). The models built using all the 
measures and the step-wise method have the same sensitivity and 
are better than the model built using PCA.

Analyses that are based on a single dataset that use the same data 
to both estimate the model and to assess its performance can lead 
to unreasonably negative biased estimates of sampling variability. 
In order to address this we repeat the random sampling with 3 
different random samples to verify if the above results are 
repeatable. For each sample the model is fit with 1645 binaries to 
build the model. Table 8 shows the fit of the various models built 
for each sample.

Based on the consistent positive and statistically significant 
correlations, indicating the sensitivity of predictions obtained in 
Table 9 we can say that relative code churn measures can be used 
as efficient predictors of system defect density (H
3
).
Our results demonstrate it is effective to use all eight measures 
rather than dropping any of them from the predictive equation. 
Each of these measures cross check on each other and any
290
abnormal behavior in one of the measures (for e.g. like a file 
getting churned too many times) would be immediately 
highlighted.
By interchanging the measures in a model equation we can get 
estimated values for all the relative measures independently. For 
example, in order to determine the maximum allowable code 
churn with respect to the file size (i.e. M1), say for a particular 
software model we fix the maximum allowable system defect 
density. We then can build a regression model with M2-M8 and 
defect density as predictors and M1 as the dependent variable.
5.4 Discriminant Analysis
Discriminant analysis, is a statistical technique used to categorize 
programs into groups based on the metric values. It has been used 
as a tool for the detection of fault-prone programs [13, 14, 18]. 
The ANSI-IEEE Std. [1] defines a fault as an accidental condition 
that causes a functional unit to fail to perform its required 
function. We use discriminant analysis to identify binaries as 
fault-prone or not fault-prone.  To classify if a binary is fault-prone
or not we use the system defect density in a normal 
confidence interval calculation as shown in equation 1. 
LB = µ
x
-z
/2
*Standard deviation of defect density... (1)
n



where
·
LB is the lower bound on system defect density;
·
µ
x
is the mean of defect density;
·
Z
/2
is the upper /2 quantile of the standard normal
distribution;
·
n is the number of observations.
We conservatively classify all binaries that have a defect density 
less than LB as not fault-prone and the remaining as fault-prone. 
Table 10 shows the eigenvalue and overall classification ability of 
using the eight measures and the three principal components. The 
eigenvalue is a measure of the discriminative ability of the 
discriminant function. The higher the eigenvalue the better is the 
discriminative ability. For all measures, the function correctly 
classifies nearly nine out of every ten binaries.

As before, we split the data set into 1645 programs to build the 
discriminant function and the remaining 820 binaries to verify the 
classification ability of the discriminant function. We perform this 
analysis using all the measures and the principal components. The 
results of this fit and classification are shown below in table 11.

Table 11 shows that the relative code churn measures have 
effective discriminant ability (comparable to prior studies done on 
industrial software [13]). We conclude that relative code churn 
measures can be used to discriminate between fault and not fault-prone
binaries (H
4
).
5.5 Limitations of Study
Internal validity. Internal validity issues arise when there are 
errors in measurement. This is negated to an extent by the fact that 
the entire data collection process is automated via the version 
control systems. However, the version control systems only 
records data upon developer check-out or check-in of files. If a 
developer made many overlapping edits to a file in a single check-out/check
-in period then a certain amount of churn will not be 
visible.  A developer also might have a file checked out for a very 
long period of time during which few changes were made, 
inflating the "weeks of churn" measure.
These concerns are alleviated to some extent by the cross check 
among the measures to identify abnormal values for any of the 
measures and the huge size and diversity of our dataset.
In our case study we provide evidence for using all the relative 
churn measures rather than a subset of values or principal 
components. This is case study specific and should be refined 
based on further results.
External validity. External validity issues may arise from the fact 
that all the data is from one software system (albeit one with many 
different components) and that the software is very large (some 44 
million lines of code) as other software systems used for a similar 
analysis might not be of comparable size.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have shown how relative code churn metrics are excellent 
predictors of defect density in a large industrial software system. 
Our case study provides strong support for the following 
conclusions:
·
Increase in relative code churn measures is accompanied 
by an increase in system defect density;
·
Using relative values of code churn predictors is better 
than using absolute values to explain the system defect 
density;
·
Relative code churn measures can be used as efficient 
predictors of system defect density; and
·
Relative code churn measures can be used to 
discriminate between fault and not fault-prone binaries.

We plan to validate our approach on other products developed 
inside Microsoft like SQL Server and Office. We also plan to 
develop standards for all the measures to provide guidance to the 
developers on the maximum allowable change. We also plan to 
investigate how testing can more effectively be directed towards 
churned code.
