Minimizing Average Flow Time on Related Machines
ABSTRACT
We give the first on-line poly-logarithmic competitve algorithm
for minimizing average flow time with preemption
on related machines, i.e., when machines can have different
speeds. This also yields the first poly-logarithmic polynomial
time approximation algorithm for this problem.
More specifically, we give an O(log
2
P и log S)-competitive
algorithm, where P is the ratio of the biggest and the smallest
processing time of a job, and S is the ratio of the highest
and the smallest speed of a machine. Our algorithm also has
the nice property that it is non-migratory. The scheduling
algorithm is based on the concept of making jobs wait for a
long enough time before scheduling them on slow machines.

algorithm is to process jobs on the machines so that some
measure of performance is optimized. Perhaps the most natural
measure is the average flow time of the jobs. Flow time
of a job is defined as the difference of its completion time
and its release time, i.e., the time it spends in the system.
This problem has received considerable attention in the
recent past [1, 2, 10]. All of these works make the assumption
that the machines are identical, i.e., they have the same
speed. But it is very natural to expect that in a heterogenous
processing environment different machines will have different
processing power, and hence different speeds. In this paper
, we consider the problem of scheduling jobs on machines
with different speeds, which is also referred to as related machines
in the scheduling literature. We allow for jobs to be
preempted. Indeed, the problem turns out to be intractable
if we do not allow preemption. Kellerer et. al. [9] showed
that the problem of minimizing average flow time without
preemption has no online algorithm with o(n) competitive
ratio even on a single machine. They also showed that it
is hard to get a polynomial time O(n
1/2
)-approximation
algorithm for this problem. So preemption is a standard,
and much needed, assumption when minimizing flow time.
In the standard notation of Graham et. al. [7], we consider
the problem Q|r
j
, pmtn| P
j
F
j
. We give the first poly-logarithmic
competitive algorithm for minimizing average
flow time on related machines. More specifically, we give an
O(log
2
P и log S)-competitive algorithm, where P is the ratio
of the biggest and the smallest processing time of a job, and
S is the ratio of the highest and the smallest speed of a machine
. This is also the first polynomial time poly-logarithmic
approximation algorithm for this problem. Despite its similarity
to the special case when machines are identical, this
problem is more difficult since we also have to worry about
the processing times of jobs.
Our algorithm is also non-migratory
, i.e., it processes a job on only one machine. This
is a desirable feature in many applications because moving
jobs across machines may have many overheads.
Related Work The problem of minimizing average flow
time (with preemption) on identical parallel machines has
received much attention in the past few years.
Leonardi
and Raz [10] showed that the Shortest Remaining Processing
Time (SRPT) algorithm has a competitive ratio of
O(log(min(
n
m
, P ))), where n is the number of jobs, and m
is the number of machines. A matching lower bound on the
competitive ratio of any on-line (randomized) algorithm for
this problem was also shown by the same authors. Awerbuch
et. al. [2] gave a non-migratory version of SRPT with
competitive ratio of O(log(min(n, P ))). Chekuri et. al.[5]
730
gave a non-migratory algorithm with competitive ratio of
O(log(min(
n
m
, P ))). One of the merits of their algorithm
was a much simpler analysis of the competitive ratio. Instead
of preferring jobs according to their remaining processing
times, their algorithm divides jobs into classes when they
arrive. A job goes to class k if its processing time is between
2
k-1
and 2
k
. The scheduling algorithm now prefers jobs of
smaller class irrespective of the remaining processing time.
We also use this notion of classes of jobs in our algorithm.
Azar and Avrahami[1] gave a non-migratory algorithm with
immediate dispatch, i.e., a job is sent to a machine as soon as
it arrives. Their algorithm tries to balance the load assigned
to each machine for each class of jobs. Their algorithm also
has the competitive ratio of O(log(min(
n
m
, P ))). It is also
interesting to note that these are also the best known results
in the off-line setting of this problem.
Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs[8] introduced the resource
augmentation model where the algorithm is allowed extra resources
when compared with the optimal off-line algorithm.
These extra resources can be either extra machines or extra
speed. For minimizing average flow time on identical
parallel machines, Phillips et. al. [11] showed that we can
get an optimal algorithm if we are given twice the speed
as compared to the optimal algorithm. In the case of single
machine scheduling, Bechheti et. al.[4] showed that we
can get O(1/)-competitive algorithms if we are give (1 + )
times more resources. Bansal and Pruhs[3] extended this
result to a variety of natural scheduling algorithms and to
L
p
norms of flow times of jobs as well. In case of identical
parallel machines, Chekuri et. al.[6] gave simple scheduling
algorithms which are O(1/
3
)-competitive with (1 + )
resource augmentation.
Our Techniques A natural algorithm to try here would
be SRPT. We feel that it will be very difficult to analyze
this algorithm in case of related machines. Further SRPT is
migratory. Non-migratory versions of SRPT can be shown
to have bad competitive ratios. To illustrate the ideas involved
, consider the following example. There is one fast
machine, and plenty of slow machines. Suppose many jobs
arrive at the same time. If we distribute these jobs to all the
available machines, then their processing times will be very
high. So at each time step, we need to be selective about
which machines we shall use for processing.
Ideas based
on distributing jobs in proportion to speeds of machines as
used by Azar and Avrahami[1] can also be shown to have
problems.
Our idea of selecting machines is the following. A job is
assigned to a machine only if it has waited for time which
is proportional to its processing time on this machine. The
intuition should be clear Г if a job is going to a slow machine,
then it can afford to wait longer before it is sent to the
machine. Hopefully in this waiting period, a faster machine
might become free in which case we shall be able to process
it in smaller time. We also use the notion of class of jobs as
introduced by Chekuri et. al.[5] which allows machines to
have a preference ordering over jobs. We feel that this idea
of delaying jobs even if a machine is available is new.
As mentioned earlier, the first challenge is to bound the
processing time of our algorithm. In fact a bulk of our paper
is about this. The basic idea used is the following Г if a
job is sent to a very slow machine, then it must have waited
long. But then most of this time, our algorithm would have
kept the fast machines busy. Since we are keeping fast machines
busy, the optimum also can not do much better. But
converting this idea into a proof requires several technical
steps.
The second step is of course to bound the flow time of
the jobs. It is easy to see that the total flow time of the
jobs in a schedule is same as the sum over all time t of
the number of waiting jobs at time t in the schedule. So it
would be enough if we show that for any time t, the number
of jobs which are waiting in our schedule is close to that
in the optimal schedule. Chekuri et. al. [5] argue this in
the following manner. Consider a time t. They show that
there is a time t &lt; t such that the number of waiting jobs
of a certain class k or less in both the optimal and their
schedule is about the same (this is not completely accurate,
but captures the main idea). Further they show that t is
such that all machines are busy processing jobs of class k or
less during (t , t). So it follows that the number of waiting
jobs of this class or less at time t are about the same in both
the schedules. We can not use this idea because we would
never be able to keep all machines busy (some machines can
be very slow). So we have to define a sequence of time steps
like t for each time and make clever use of geometric scaling
to show that the flow time is bounded.
PRELIMINARIES
We consider the on-line problem of minimizing total flow
time for related machines. Each job j has a processing requirement
of p
j
and a release date of r
j
. There are m machines
, numbered from 1 to m. The machines can have
different speeds, and the processing time of a job j on a
machine is p
j
divided by the speed of the machine. The
slowness of machine is the reciprocal of its speed. It will be
easier to deal with slowness, and so we shall use slowness
instead of speed in the foregoing discussion. Let s
i
denote
the slowness of machine i. So the time taken by job j to
process on machine i is p
j
и s
i
. Assume that the machines
have been numbered so that s
1
s
2
и и и  s
m
. We shall
assume without loss of generality that processing time, release
dates, and slowness are integers. We shall use the term
volume of a set of jobs for denoting their processing time on
a unit speed machine.
Let
A be a scheduling algorithm. The completion time
of a job j in A is denoted by C
A
j
. The flow time of j in A
is defined as F
A
j
= C
A
j
- r
j
. Our goal is to find an on-line
scheduling algorithm which minimizes the total flow time of
jobs. Let
O denote the optimal off-line scheduling algorithm.
We now develop some notations. Let P denote the ratio of
the largest to the smallest processing times of the jobs, and
S be the ratio of the largest to the smallest slowness of the
machines. For ease of notation, we assume that the smallest
processing requirement of any job is 1, and the smallest slowness
of a machine is 1. Let  and  be suitable chosen large
enough constants. We divide the jobs and the machines into
classes. A job j is said to be in class k if p
j
[
k-1
,
k
)
and a machine i is said to be in class l if s
i
[
l-1
,
l
).
Note that there are O(log P ) classes for jobs and O(log S)
classes for machines. Given a schedule
A, we say that a job
j is active at time t in A if r
j
t but j has not finished
processing by time t in A.
SCHEDULING ALGORITHM
We now describe the scheduling algorithm. The under-731
lying idea of the algorithm is the following -- if we send a
job j to machine i, we make sure that it waits for at least
p
j
и s
i
units of time (which is its processing time on machine
i). Intuitively, the extra waiting time can be charged to its
processing time. Of course, we still need to make sure that
the processing time does not blow up in this process.
The algorithm maintains a central pool of jobs. When a
new job gets released, it first goes to the central pool and
waits there to get assigned to a machine. Let W (t) denote
the set of jobs in the central pool at time t. Our algorithm
will assign each job to a unique machine -- if a job j gets
assigned to a machine i, then j will get processed by machine
i only. Let A
i
(t) be the set of active jobs at time t which
have been assigned to machine i. We shall maintain the
invariant that A
i
(t) contains at most one job of each class.
So
|A
i
(t)|  log P .
We say that a job j  W (t) of class k is mature for a
machine i of class l at time t, if it has waited for at least
k
и
l
time in the central pool, i.e., t - r
j

k
и
l
. For
any time t, we define a total order  on the jobs in W (t)
as follows Г j  j if either (i) class(j) &lt; class(j ), or (ii)
class(j) = class(j ) and r
j
&gt; r
j
(in case class(j) = class(j )
and r
j
= r
j
we can order them arbitrarily).
Now we describe the actual details of the algorithm. Initially
, at time 0, A
i
(0) is empty for each machine.
At
each time t, the algorithm considers machines in the order
1, 2, . . . , m (recall that the machines have been arranged in
the ascending order of their slowness). Let us describe the
algorithm when it considers machine i. Let M
i
(t) be the
jobs in W (t) which are mature for machine i at time t. Let
j  M
i
(t) be the smallest job according to the total order
. If class(j) &lt; class(j ) for all jobs j  A
i
(t), then we
assign j to machine i (i.e., we delete j from W (t) and add
it to A
i
(t)).
Once the algorithm has considered all the machines at
time t, each machine i processes the job of smallest class
in A
i
(t) at time t. This completes the description of our
algorithm. It is also easy to see that the machines need to
perform the above steps for only a polynomial number of
time steps t (i.e., when a job finishes or matures for a class
of machines).
We remark that both the conditions in the definition of

are necessary. The condition (i) is clear because it prefers
smaller jobs. Condition (ii) makes sure that we make old
jobs wait longer so that they can mature for slower machines.
It is easy to construct examples where if we do not obey
condition (ii) then slow machines will never get used and so
we will incur very high flow time.
ANALYSIS
We now show that the flow time incurred by our algorithm
is within poly-logarithmic factor of that of the optimal algorithm
. The outline of the proof is as follows. We first
argue that the total processing time incurred by our algorithm
is not too large. Once we have shown this, we can
charge the waiting time of all the jobs in A
i
(t) for all machines
i and time t to the total processing time. After this,
we show that the total waiting time of the jobs in the central
pool is also bounded by poly-logarithmic factor times
the optimum's flow time.
Let
A denote our algorithm. For a job j, define the dispatch
time d
A
j
of j in A as the time at which it is assigned to
a machine. For a job j and class l of machines, let t
M
(j, l)
denote the time at which j matures for machines of class l,
i.e., t
M
(j, l) = r
j
+
k

l
, where k is the class of job j. Let
F
A
denote the total flow time of our algorithm. For a job j
let P
A
j
denote the time it takes to process job j in A (i.e.,
the processing time of j in A). Similarly, for a set of jobs
J define P
A
J
as the total processing time incurred by
A on
these jobs. Let P
A
denote the sum P
j
P
A
j
, i.e., the total
processing time incurred by
A. Define F
O
, P
O
j
, P
O
J
and P
O
similarly. Let m
l
denote the number of machines of class l.
4.1
Bounding the Processing Time
We shall now compare P
A
with F
O
. For each value of
class k of jobs and class l of machines, let J(k, l) be the jobs
of class k which get processed by A on machines of class
l. For each value of k and l, we shall bound the processing
time incurred by
A on J(k, l). So fix a class k of jobs and
class l of machines.
The idea of the proof is as follows. We shall divide the
time line into intervals I
1
= (t
1
b
, t
1
e
), I
2
= (t
2
b
, t
2
e
), . . . so that
each interval I
q
satisfies the following property Г
A is almost
busy in I
q
processing jobs of class at most k on machines
of class l - 1 or less. Further these jobs have release time
at least t
q
b
. We shall denote these jobs by H
q
. Now, if
O
schedules jobs in J(k, l) on machines of class l or more, we
have nothing to prove since
O would incur at least as much
processing time as we do for these jobs. If
O schedules some
jobs in J(k, l) on machines of class l - 1 or less during the
interval I
q
, then one of these two cases must happen Г (i)
some jobs in H
q
need to be processed on machines of class
l or more, or (ii) some jobs in H
q
get processed after time
t
q
e
. We shall show that both of these cases are good for us
and we can charge the processing times of jobs in J(k, l) to
the flow time of jobs in H
q
in
O.
Let us formalize these ideas (see Figure 1). The starting
points of the intervals I
1
, I
2
, . . . will be in decreasing order,
i.e., t
1
b
&gt; t
2
b
&gt; и и и (so we shall work backwards in time while
defining these intervals). Suppose we have defined intervals
I
1
, . . . , I
q-1
so far. Let J
q
(k, l) denote the set of jobs in
J(k, l) which get released before interval I
q-1
begins, i.e.,
before t
q-1
b
(J
1
(k, l) is defined as J(k, l)).
Now we define I
q
. Let j
q
0
J
q
(k, l) be the job with the
highest dispatch time. Let r
q
0
denote the release time of j
q
0
.
Let k
q
0
denote the class of job j
q
0
. Let d
q
0
denote the dispatch
time of j
q
0
. The right end-point t
q
e
of I
q
is defined as d
q
0
.
Consider the jobs in J(k, l) which get dispatched during
(r
q
0
, d
q
0
). Let j
q
1
be such a job with the earliest release date.
Define r
q
1
, k
q
1
, d
q
1
similarly.
Let H
q
0
(l ), l &lt; l, be the set of jobs of class at most k
q
0
which are dispatched to a machine of class l during the time
interval (t
M
(j
q
0
, l ), d
q
0
). Note that the phrase "class at most
k
q
0
" in the previous sentence is redundant because we cannot
dispatch a job of class greater than k
q
0
during (t
M
(j
q
0
, l ), d
q
0
)
on machines of class l (otherwise we should have dispatched
j
q
0
earlier). Let H
q
0
denote

l-1
l =1
H
q
0
(l ). Define H
q
1
(l ), H
q
1
similarly.
If all jobs in H
q
1
H
q
0
get released after r
q
1
, we stop the
process here. Otherwise find a job in H
q
1
H
q
0
which has the
earliest release date, let j
q
2
denote this job. As before define
r
q
2
as the release date of j
q
2
, and k
q
2
as the class of j
q
2
. Again
define H
q
2
(l ) as the set of jobs (of class at most k
q
2
) which
get dispatched on machines of class l during (t
M
(j
q
2
, l ), d
q
2
).
Define H
q
2
analogously.
So now assume we have defined

j
q
i+1
as the job in H
q
i
with the earliest release date. Define
H
q
i+1
in a similar manner (see Figure 1). We remark that
the first two steps of this process differ from the subsequent
steps. This we will see later is requierd to ensure that the
intervals do not overlap too much. The following simple
observation shows that this process will stop.
Claim 4.1. For i  2, k
q
i
&lt; k
q
i-1
.
Proof. Consider the job j
q
i
H
q
i-1
(l ). A prefers j
q
i
over
j
q
i-1
. If class(j
q
i
) = class(j
q
i-1
), release time of j
q
i
must be
at least that of j
q
i-1
. But this is not the case. Thus, class of
j
q
i
must be less than that of j
q
i-1
.
Suppose this process stops after u
q
steps. Define the beginning
of I
q
, i.e., t
q
b
as r
q
u
q
.
This completes our description of I
q
.
Let H
q
denote

i
H
q
i
. We are now ready to show that interval I
q
is sufficiently
long, and that for a large fraction of this time, all
machines of class less than l are processing jobs of class less
than k which are released in this interval itself. This would
be valuable in later arguing that
O could not have sched-uled
jobs of J(k, l) on the lower class machines and thereby
incurred small processing time.
Lemma 4.2. Length of the interval I
q
is at least
k

l
.
Proof. Indeed, job j
q
0
must wait for at least
k

l
amount
of time before being dispatched to a machine of class l. So

Lemma 4.3. H
q
consists of jobs of class at most k and
all jobs in H
q
are released after t
q
b
.
Proof. The first statement is clear from the definition
of H
q
. Let us look at H
q
i
. As argued in proof of Claim 4.1
all jobs of class k
q
i
in H
q
i
are released after r
q
i
. If all jobs of
class less than k
q
i
in H
q
i
are released after r
q
i
, then we are
done. Otherwise, all such jobs are released after r
q
i+1
(after
r
q
2
if i = 0). This completes the proof of the lemma.
Lemma 4.4. A machine of class l &lt; l processes jobs of
H
q
for at least
|I
q
| - 6 и
k

l
amount of time during I
q
.
Proof. Let us fix a machine i of class l &lt; l. Let us
consider the interval (r
q
p
, d
q
p
). Job j
q
p
matures for i at time
t
M
(j
q
p
, l ). So machine i must be busy during (t
M
(j
q
p
, l ), d
q
p
),
otherwise we could have dispatched j
q
p
earlier. We now want
to argue that machine i is mainly busy during this interval
processing jobs from H
q
.
Let j be a job which is processed by i during (t
M
(j
q
p
, l ), d
q
p
).
We have already noted that j can be of class at most k
q
p
. If j
gets dispatched after t
M
(j
q
p
, l ), then by definition it belongs
to H
q
. If j gets dispatched before t
M
(j
q
p
, l ), it must belong
to A
i
(t ). But A
i
(t ) can contain at most one job of each
class. So the total processing time taken by jobs of A
i
(t )
during (t , d
p
) is at most
l
и(+
2
+
и и и+
k
q
p
)
3/2и
k
q
p

l
.
So during (r
q
p
, d
q
p
), i processes jobs from H
q
except perhaps
for a period of length (t
M
(j
q
p
, l ) - r
q
p
) + 3/2 и
k
q

=
5/2 и
k
q
p

l
. Since

p
(r
q
p
, d
p
) covers I
q
, the amount of time
i does not process jobs from H
q
is at most 5/2 и
l
(
k
+

k
+
и и и + 1), which proves the lemma.
We would like to charge the processing time for jobs in
J(k, l) in our solution to the flow time of jobs in H
q
in
O.
But to do this we require that the sets H
q
be disjoint. We
next prove that this is almost true.
Lemma 4.5. For any q, I
q
and I
q+2
are disjoint. Hence
H
q
and H
q+2
are also disjoint.
Proof. Recall that J
q+1
(k, l) is the set of jobs in J(k, l)
which get released before t
q
b
. However some of these jobs
may get dispatched after t
q
b
and hence I
q
and I
q+1
can intersect
.
Consider some job j  J
q+1
(k, l) which is dispatched during
I
q
. Now, observe that j
q+1
0
is released before t
q
b
(by
definition of J
q+1
(k, l)) and dispatched after j. So, j gets
dispatched in (r
q
0
, d
q
0
). This means that release date of j
q+1
1
must be before release date of j. But t
q+1
b
r
q+1
1
and so, j
is released after t
q+1
b
. But then j /
J
q+2
(k, l). So all jobs
in J
q+2
(k, l) get dispatched before I
q
begins, which implies
that I
q
and I
q+2
are disjoint.
Consider an interval I
q
. Let D
q
(k, l) denote the jobs in
J(k, l) which get released after t
q
b
but dispatched before t
q
e
.
It is easy to see that D
q
(k, l) is a superset of J
q
(k, l) J
q+1
(k, l). So
q
D
q
(k, l) covers all of J(k, l).
Now we would like to charge the processing time of jobs
in D
q
(k, l) to the flow time incurred by O on the jobs in H
q
.
Before we do this, let us first show that
O incurs significant
733
amount of flow time processing the jobs in H
q
.
This is
proved in the technical theorem below whose proof we defer
to the appendix.
Theorem 4.6. Consider a time interval I = (t
b
, t
e
) of
length T . Suppose there exists a set of jobs J
I
such that
every job j  J
I
is of class at most k and is released after
t
b
. Further
A dispatches all the jobs in J
I
during I and only
on machines of class less than l. Further, each machine i
of class l &lt; l satisfies the following condition : machine i
processes jobs from J
I
for at least T - 6 и
k
и
l
amount of
time. Assuming T
k
и
l
, the flow time F
O
J
I
incurred by
O on the jobs in J
I
is at least  `P
A
J
I
┤.
Substituting t
b
= t
q
b
, t
e
= t
q
e
, I = I
q
, T = |I
q
|, J
I
= H
q
in
the statement of Theorem 4.6 and using Lemmas 4.2, 4.3,
4.4, we get
P
A
H
q
O(F
O
H
q
).
(1)
We are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section
.
Theorem 4.7. The processing time incurred by A on
D
q
(k, l), namely P
A
D
q
(k,l)
, is O(F
O
H
q
+ F
O
D
q
(k,l)
).
Proof. Let V denote the volume of D
q
(k, l). By Lemma
4.4, machines of class l do not process jobs from H
q
for at
most 6
и
k

l
units of time during I
q
. This period translates
to a job-volume of at most 6 и
k
. If V is sufficiently small
then it can be charged to the processing time (or equivalently
the flow time in
O) of the jobs in H
q
.
Lemma 4.8. If V  c и  и
k
(m
0
+ . . . + m
l-1
) where c is
a constant, then P
A
D
q
(k,l)
is O(F
O
H
q
).
Proof. The processing time incurred by A on D
q
(k, l) is
at most
l
V = O(
k

l+1
и(m
0
+ . . .+m
l-1
)). Now, Lemmas
4.2 and 4.4 imply that machines of class l &lt; l process jobs
from H
q
for at least
k

l
/2 amount of time. So P
A
H
q
is at
least
k

l
(m
0
+ . . . + m
l-1
)/2. Using equation (1), we get
the result.
So from now on we shall assume that V  cи и
k+1
(m
0
+
. . . + m
l-1
) for a sufficiently large constant c. We deal with
easy cases first :
Lemma 4.9. In each of the following cases P
A
D
q
(k,l)
is
O(F
O
D
q
(k,l)
+ F
O
H
q
) :
(i) At least V /2 volume of D
q
(k, l) is processed on machines
of class at least l by O.
(ii) At least V /4 volume of D
q
(k, l) is finished by O after
time t
q
e
k

l
/2.
(iii) At least V /8 volume of H
q
is processed by
O on machines
of class l or more.
Proof. Note that P
A
D
q
(k,l)
is at most V
l
. If (i) happens,
O pays at least V/2 и
l-1
amount of processing time for
D
q
(k, l) and so we are done. Suppose case (ii) occurs. All
jobs in D
q
(k, l) get dispatched by time t
q
e
. So they must get
released before t
q
e
k

l
. So at least 1/4 volume of these
jobs wait for at least
k

l
/2 amount of time in O. This
means that F
O
D
q
(k,l)
is at least V /8 и
l
, because each job has
size at most
k
. This again implies the lemma. Case (iii) is
similar to case (i).
So we can assume that none of the cases in Lemma 4.9
occur.
Now, consider a time t between t
q
e
k

l
/2 and
t
q
e
. Let us look at machines of class 1 to l - 1. O finishes
at least V /4 volume of D
q
(k, l) on these machines before
time t. Further, at most V /8 volume of H
q
goes out from
these machines to machines of higher class. The volume that
corresponds to time slots in which these machines do not
process jobs of H
q
in
A is at most V/16 (for a sufficiently
large constant c). So, at least V /16 amount of volume of
H
q
must be waiting in
O at time t. So the total flow time
incurred by
O on H
q
is at least V /(16
k
)
и
k

l
/2 which
again is (V
l
). This proves the theorem.
Combining the above theorem with Lemma 4.5, we get
Corollary 4.10. P
A
J(k,l)
is O(F
O
), and so P
A
is
O(log S log P и F
O
).
4.2
Bounding the flow time
We now show that the average flow time incurred by our
algorithm is within poly-logarithmic factor of that incurred
by the optimal solution. We shall say that a job j is waiting
at time t in A if it is in the central pool at time t in A and
has been released before time t.
Let V
A
k
(t) denote the volume of jobs of class at most
k which are waiting at time t in A. Define V
O
k
(t) as the
remaining volume of jobs of class at most k which are active
at time t in O. Note the slight difference in the definitions
for
A and O -- in case of A, we are counting only those jobs
which are in the central pool, while in
O we are counting
all active jobs. Our goal is to show that for all values of k,
P
t
V
A
k
(t) is bounded from above by P
t
V
O
k
(t) plus small
additive factors, i.e., O(
k
и(P
O
+ P
A
)). Once we have this,
the desired result will follow from standard calculations.
Before we go to the details of the analysis, let us first show
how to prove such a fact when all machines are of the same
speed, say 1. The argument for this case follows directly
from [5], but we describe it to develop some intuition for the
more general case. Fix a time t and class k of jobs. Suppose
all machines are processing jobs of class at most k at time
t in our schedule. Let t be the first time before t at which
there is at least one machine in
A which is not processing
jobs of class k or less (if there is no such time, set t as
0). It follows that at time t there are no jobs of class k or
less which are mature for these machines (since all machines
are identical, a job becomes mature for all the machines
at the same time). So these jobs must have been released
after t k
. During (t k
, t ), the optimal schedule can
process at most m и
k
volume of jobs of class at most k. So
it follows that V
A
k
(t ) - V
O
k
(t ) is at most m и
k
. Since our
schedule processes jobs of class at most k during (t , t), we
get V
A
k
(t) - V
O
k
(t)  x
A
(t) и
k
, where x
A
(t) denotes the
number of busy machines at timer t in our schedule (x
A
(t)
is same as m because all machines are busy at time t). The
other case when a machine may be processing jobs of class
more than k or remain idle at time t can be shown similarly
to yield the same expression. Adding this for all values of t,
we get P
t
V
A
k
(t) - P
t
V
O
k
(t) is at most
k
и P
A
, which is
what we wanted to show.
This argument does not extend to the case when machines
can have different speeds. There might be a very slow machine
which is not processing jobs of class k or less (it may
be idle), but then the jobs which are waiting could have
been released much earlier and so we cannot argue that the
734
volume of remaining jobs of class at most k at time t in the
two schedules are close. This complicates our proof and instead
of defining one time t as above, we need to define a
sequence of times.
Before we describe this process, we need more notations.
These are summarized in the table below for ease of reference
.
Let j
k
(t)  J
k
(t) be the job with the earliest release date.
Let r
k
(t) denote the release date of job j
k
(t), and c
k
(t) denote
the class of j
k
(t). Let l
k
(t) denote the largest l such that
j
k
(t) has matured for machines of class l at time t. In other
words, l
k
(t) is the highest value of l such that t
M
(j, l)  t.
Observe that all machines of class l
k
(t) or less must be busy
processing jobs of class at most c
k
(t) at time t, otherwise our
algorithm should have dispatched j by time t. Our proof will
use the following lemma.

Proof. Let V
A
denote the volume of jobs of class at most
k which are processed by A on machines of class l
k
(t) - 1 or
less during (r
k
(t), t). Define U
A
as the volume of jobs of class
at most k which are processed by A on machines of class
l
k
(t) or more during (r
k

O
and U

similarly.
Clearly, V

(r

Let us look at V
O
- V
A
first.
Any machine of class
l  l
k
(t) - 1 is busy in A during (t
M
(j
k
(t), l ), t) processing
jobs of class at most c
k
(t). The amount of volume O can
process on such machines during (r
k

(j

most
m

и
ck(t)

l

l -1
, which is at most m

c
k
(t)
. So we
get V
O
- V
A
m
(l

и  и
c
k
(t)
.
Let us now consider V
A
k
(r
k
(t)) - V
O
k
(r
k
(t)). Let us consider
jobs of class c
k
(t) or more which are waiting at time
r
k
(t) in A (so they were released before r
k
(t)). By our definition
of j
k
(t), all such jobs must be processed by time
t in A. If l  l
k
(t) - 1, then such jobs can be done on
machines of class l only during (t
M
(j
k
(t), l ), t). So again
we can show that the total volume of such jobs is at most
m
(l
k

и  и
c

+ U

.
Thus we get V

Finally note that U

is at most P

l-1
. Combining
everything, we get the result.
The rest of the proof is really about unraveling the expression
in the lemma above. To illustrate the ideas involved,
let us try to prove the special case for jobs of class 1 only.
The lemma above implies that V

m
(l

(r

l-1
. We are really interested in
P
t
(V
A
1
(t) - V
O
1
(t)). Now, the sum P
t
m
(l
1
(t)-1)
is not a
problem because we know that at time t all machines of class
l
1
(t) or less must be busy in A. So, x
A
(t)  m
(l
1
(t)-1)
. So
P
t
m
(l
1
(t)-1)
is at most P
t
x
A
(t), which is the total processing
time of
A. It is little tricky to bound the second
term. We shall write P
ll
1
(t) P
O
l
(r

(t),t)

l-1
as
P
ll
1
(t)
P
t
t =r
1
(t) x
O
l
(t )

l-1
.
We can think of this as saying
that at time time t , r
1
(t)  t  t, we are charging 1/
l-1
amount to each machine of class l which is busy at time t
in
O. Note that here l is at least l
1
(t).
Now we consider P
t
P
ll
1
(t)
P
t
t =r
1
(t) x
O
l
(t )

l-1
. For a fixed
time t and a machine i of class l which is busy at time t
in
O, let us see for how many times t we charge to i. We
charge to i at time t if t lies in the interval (r
1
(t), t), and
l  l
1
(t). Suppose this happens. We claim that t - t has
to be at most
l+1
. Indeed otherwise t - r
1
(t)
l+1
and so j
1
(t) has matured for machines of class l + 1 as well.
But then l &lt; l
1
(t). So the total amount of charge machine i
gets at time t is at most
l+1
и 1/
l-1
= O(1). Thus, the
total sum turns out to be at most a constant times the total
processing time of
O.
Let us now try to prove this for the general case. We
build some notation first. Fix a time t and class k. We
shall define a sequence of times t
0
, t
1
, и и и and a sequence of
jobs j
0
(t), j
1
(t), . . . associated with this sequence of times.
c
i
(t) shall denote the class of the job j
i
(t). Let us see how
we define this sequence. First of all t
0
= t, and j
0
(t) is
the job j
k
(t) (as defined above). Recall the definition of
j
k
(t) Г it is the job with the earliest release date among all
jobs of class at most k which are waiting at time t in A.
Note that c
0
(t), the class of this job, can be less than k.
Now suppose we have defined t
0
, . . . , t
i
and j
0
(t), . . . , j
i
(t),
i  0. t
i+1
is the release date of j
i
(t). j
i+1
(t) is defined as
the job j
c
i
(t)-1
(t
i+1
), i.e., the job with the earliest release
date among all jobs of class less than c
i
(t) waiting at time
t
i+1
in
A. We shall also define a sequence of classes of
machines l
0
(t), l
1
(t), . . . in the following manner Г l
i
(t) is the
highest class l of machines such that job j
i
(t) has matured
for machines of class l at time t
i
. Figure 2 illustrates these
definitions. The vertical line at time t
i
denotes l
i
(t) Г the
height of this line is proportional to l
i
(t).
We note the following simple fact.
Claim 4.12.
l
i
(t)
и
c
i
(t)
t
i
- t
i+1

l
i

и
c

.
Proof. Indeed t
i+1
is the release date of j
i
(t) and j
i
(t)
matures for machines of class l
i
(t) at time t
i
, but not for
machines of class l
i+1
(t) at time t
i
.
The statement in Lemma 4.11 can be unrolled iteratively
to give the following inequality :

Consider a machine of class

we charge it 1/

we charge 1/

busy in

Let us see how we can simplify the picture. We say that
the index i is suffix maximum if l

(i = 0 is always suffix maximum). In Figure 2, t

Let the indices which are suffix

says that we can consider only suffix maximum indices in

Figure 3 shows what Lemma 4.13 is saying. In the lightly
shaded region, if there is a machine of class l which is busy
at some time t in A, we charge it 1/
l
units at time t . In
the darkly shaded region if there is a machine i of class l
which is busy at time t in O we charge it 1/
l-1
units.
Now we try to bound the charges on the darkly shaded
region for all time t. Let us fix a machine h of class l.
Suppose h is busy in O at time t . We are charging 1/
l-1
amount to h at time t if the following condition holds : for
all i such that t
i
t , l
i
(t) is at most l. Now we ask, if we
fix t , for how many values of t do we charge h at time t ?
The following claim shows that this can not be too large.
Claim 4.14. Given a machine h of class l, we can charge
it for the darkly shaded region at time t for at most 2 и
l+1
и

k
values of t.
Proof. Suppose we charge h at time t for some value
of t. Fix this t. Clearly t  t . Let i be the largest index
such that t  t

Now we look at the charges on the lightly shaded region.
Let h be a machine of class l which is busy in A at time t .
As argued earlier, we charge 1/

units to h at time t if the
following condition holds Г there exists a suffix maximum
index i

such that t lies in the interval (t

Further for all suffix maximum indices i &lt; i

the case that l

values of t do we charge h at time t .

The final result now follows from standard calculations.
Theorem 4.16. F
A
is O(log S и log
2
P и F
O
).
Proof. We have already bounded the processing time of
A. Once a job gets dispatched to a machine i, its waiting
time can be charged to the processing done by i. Since at
any time t, there are at most log P active jobs dispatched to
a machine, the total waiting time of jobs after their dispatch
time is at most O(log P и P
A
). So we just need to bound the
time for which jobs are waiting in the central pool.
Let n
A
k
(t) be the number of jobs of class k waiting in the
central pool at time t in our algorithm. Let n
O
k
(t) be the
number of jobs of class k which are active at time t in O
(note the difference in the definitions of the two quantities).
Since jobs waiting in the central pool in
A have not been
processed at all, it is easy to see that n

We know that total flow time of a schedule is equal to the
sum over all time t of the number of active jobs at time t in
the schedule. So adding the equation above for all values of
k and using Corollary 4.10 implies the theorem.

Appendix
Proof of Theorem 4.6.
Let M denote the set of machines
of class less than l. First observe that the processing
time incurred by
A on J
I
is at most twice of
|M | и T (the
factor twice comes because there may be some jobs which
are dispatched during I but finish later -- there can be at
most one such job for a given class and a given machine).
So we will be done if we can show that F
O
J
I
is (
|M | и T ).
Let V be the volume of jobs in J
I
which are done by
O
on machines of class l or more. If V
|M |иT

l+1
, then we are
done because then the processing time incurred by
O on J
I
is at least V и
l
. So we will assume in the rest of the proof
that V
|M |иT

l+1
.
Let i be a machine of class less than l. We shall say that
i is good is i processes jobs from J
I
for at least T /4 units
of time during I in the optimal solution O. Otherwise we
say that i is bad. Let G denote the set of good machines. If
|G|
|M |

, then we are done again, because P
O
J
I
is at least
|G| и T/4. Let B denote the set of bad machines.
So we can assume that the number of good machines is
at most 1/ fraction of the number of machines of class less
than l. Now consider a time t in the interval (t
b
+ T /2, t
e
).
Claim 6.1. At time t, at least
k
|M | volume of jobs from
J
I
is waiting in
O.
Proof. Let V
1
denote the volume of jobs from J
I
which
is done by
A during (t
b
, t). Let V
2
denote the volume of jobs
from J
I
which is done by
O on machines of class less than
l during (t
b
, t). Recall that for a machine i, s
i
denotes the
slowness of i.
Since a machine i of class l &lt; l does not perform jobs
from J
I
for at most 6
k

l
amount of time during I, we see
that V

P
iM t-t

, where c
i
denotes the class
of i. Let us look at V
2
now. In
O all bad machines do not
process jobs from J
I
for at least 3T /4 units of time during I.
So they do not process jobs from J
I
for at least T /4 units of
time during (t
b
, t
b
+T /2). So V

This shows that V

For a bad machine i, T /4 - 6

(assuming  is large enough). So, we can see that this
difference is at least P

l-1
(
|B|/8 - 6|G|),
which is at least
T |M |
10
l-1
, because we have assumed that
|B| is
larger than
|G| by a sufficiently high constant factor. Recall
that V is the volume of jobs in J
I
which is done by
O on
machines of class l or more. Clearly, the volume of jobs from
J
I
which is waiting at time t in O is at least V
1
- V
2
- V .
But V is at most
T |M |

l+1
. Hence the volume waiting at time
t is at least
T |M |

l
. This proves the lemma.
Since each job
in J
I
is of size at most
k
, we see that at least (
|M |) jobs
are waiting at time t. Summing over all values of t in the
range (t
b
+ T /2, t
e
) implies the theorem.
