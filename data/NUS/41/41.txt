Autonomous and Distributed Node Recovery in Wireless Sensor Networks
ABSTRACT
Intrusion or misbehaviour detection systems are an important
and widely accepted security tool in computer and wireless
sensor networks. Their aim is to detect misbehaving or
faulty nodes in order to take appropriate countermeasures,
thus limiting the damage caused by adversaries as well as by
hard or software faults. So far, however, once detected, misbehaving
nodes have just been isolated from the rest of the
sensor network and hence are no longer usable by running
applications. In the presence of an adversary or software
faults, this proceeding will inevitably lead to an early and
complete loss of the whole network.
For this reason, we propose to no longer expel misbehaving
nodes, but to recover them into normal operation. In this
paper, we address this problem and present a formal specification
of what is considered a secure and correct node
recovery algorithm together with a distributed algorithm
that meets these properties. We discuss its requirements
on the soft- and hardware of a node and show how they can
be fulfilled with current and upcoming technologies. The
algorithm is evaluated analytically as well as by means of
extensive simulations, and the findings are compared to the
outcome of a real implementation for the BTnode sensor
platform. The results show that recovering sensor nodes is
an expensive, though feasible and worthwhile task. Moreover
, the proposed program code update algorithm is not
only secure but also fair and robust.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of many wireless
communicating sensor nodes. Essentially, these are mi-crocontrollers
including a communication unit and a power
supply, as well as several attached sensors to examine the
environment. Sensor nodes typically have very limited computing
and storage capacities and can only communicate
with their direct neighbourhood. In addition, WSNs have
to work unattended most of the time as their operation area
cannot or must not be visited. Reasons can be that the area
is inhospitable, unwieldy, or ecologically too sensitive for human
visitation; or that manual maintenance would just be
too expensive.
More and more, WSN applications are supposed to operate
in hostile environments, where their communication
might be overheard and nodes can be removed or manipu-lated
. Regarding attacks on sensor networks, one differentiates
between so called outsider and insider attacks <A href="41.html#9">[21]. In
the former, a potential attacker tries to disclose or influence
a confidential outcome without participating in its computation
; for instance, by intercepting, modifying, or adding
messages. In the latter, by contrast, an attacker appears as
an adequate member of the WSN by either plausibly impersonating
regular nodes or by capturing and compromising
them.
Cryptographic methods, such as encrypting or signing
messages, are an effective protection against attacks from
outside the network, but are of only limited help against
insider attacks. Once an adversary possesses one or several
valid node identities (including the associated keys), it
can actively participate in the operations of the WSN and
influence the computed results.
Intrusion or misbehaviour detection systems (IDS), on the
other hand, are an important and widely accepted security
tool against insider attacks <A href="41.html#9">[18, 21].
They allow for the
detection of malicious or failed nodes and the application
of appropriate countermeasures. So far, however, once detected
, misbehaving nodes have just been isolated from the
rest of the network and hence are no longer usable by running
applications. In the presence of an adversary or software
faults, this proceding will inevitably result in an early
and complete loss of the whole network. Therefore, not only
the detection of misbehaving nodes is important, but also
the selection and application of effective countermeasures.
Their aim must not be to simply expel suspected nodes but
to recover them into correct operation. In combination, the
advantages of an IDS together with the appropriate recov-113
ery measures are manifold. Not only do they help in case of
program faults (e.g., deadlocks or crashes) but even if an attacker
manages to capture a node and to abuse it for his own
purposes, there is a chance that the aberrant behaviour of
this node will be detected and the node be recovered, thus
nullifying the attack. However, due to the size of sensor
networks, both the IDS functionality as well as the recovery
measures should be autonomously executed by the involved
nodes in a distributed and cooperative manner and without
the need for central instances with extended functionality.
Motivated by the above mentioned insights, this paper focuses
on autonomous an distributed node recovery in wireless
sensor networks and proposes three alternative countermeasures
to node expelling; namely to switch a node off,
to restart it, and to update its program code. We formally
specify what we consider a secure and correct recovery algorithm
, present a distributed algorithm which meets these
properties, and reason why it can help to extend the overall
lifetime of a sensor network. In addition, we discuss the limitations
of the proposed countermeasures, show which hard-and
software parts of a corrupted node must still work correctly
to make them applicable, and explain how this can
be achieved with current and upcoming technologies. More
precisely, the contributions of this paper are as follows:
· We propose to no longer expel misbehaving nodes, but
to either (i) switch them off, (ii) restart them, or (iii)
update their program code.
· We give a formal specification of a secure and correct
recovery algorithm.
· We present a provably secure and robust distributed
node recovery algorithm.
· We discuss the requirements on the soft- and hardware
of a node in order to make the countermeasures applicable
and show how they can be fulfilled with current
and upcoming technologies.
The algorithm is evaluated analytically as well as by means
of extensive simulations and the findings are compared to
the outcome of a real implementation for the BTnode sensor
platform. The results show that recovering sensor nodes
is an expensive, though feasible and worthwhile task. Moreover
, the proposed program code update algorithm is not
only provably secure but also fair and robust. It distributes
the update load equally over all participating nodes and terminates
as long as at least one of them remains correct.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section <A href="41.html#2">1.1
presents the related work in the area of intrusion detection
and node recovery in wireless sensor networks. Section <A href="41.html#3">2
states the required definitions and assumptions. Section <A href="41.html#4">3
specifies the proposed recovery algorithm whose correctness
is proven in section <A href="41.html#6">4. The algorithm is evaluated in section
<A href="41.html#6">5 and section <A href="41.html#8">6 concludes the paper.
1.1
Related Work
In this section, we present related work in the area of intrusion
detection in wireless sensor networks. Additionally,
related work regarding program code updates in sensor networks
is also discussed, as we propose program code updates
as a mean to recover nodes.
Intrusion Detection
In recent years, intrusion detection systems for wireless sensor
networks have become a major research issue and several
approaches have been proposed. However, to our best
knowledge, the only countermeasure applied so far was to
(logically) exclude malicious nodes.
Khalil, Bagchi, and Nina-Rotaru present a distributed
IDS where nodes monitor the communication among their
neighbours <A href="41.html#9">[14]. For each monitored node a malignity counter
is maintained and incremented whenever the designated node
misbehaves. Once a counter exceeds a predefined threshold,
an according alert is sent to all neighbours and if enough
alerts are received the accused node is revoked from the
neighbourhood list. Hsin and Liu suggest a two-phase timeout
system for neighbour monitoring which uses active probing
to reduce the probability of false-positives <A href="41.html#9">[10].
A rule-based IDS, which proceeds in three phases, is proposed
by da Silva et al. <A href="41.html#9">[5]. In the first phase, messages are
overheard and the collected information is filtered and ordered
. In the second phase, the detection rules are applied
to the gathered data and each inconsistency counted as a
failure. Finally, in the third phase, the number or failures is
compared to the expected amount of occasional failures and
if too high an intrusion alert is raised.
Inverardi, Mostarda and Navarra introduce a framework
which enables the automatic translation of IDS specifications
into program code <A href="41.html#9">[12]. The so generated code is then
installed on the sensor nodes in order to locally detect violations
of the node interaction policies. In the approach by
Herbert et al. <A href="41.html#9">[6], predefined correctness properties (invariants
) are associated with conditions of individual nodes or
the whole network and program code to verify these invariants
is automatically inserted during compilation.
A reputation-based IDS framework for WSNs where sensor
nodes maintain a reputation for other nodes is presented
by Ganeriwal and Srivastava <A href="41.html#9">[8]. It uses a Bayesian formula-tion
for reputation representation, update, and integration.
Program Code Update
The main difference between the already available reprogramming
algorithms and the proposed recovery measures
are that the former focus on the propagation of new program
releases among all nodes of the network, whereas the
aim of the latter is the local and autonomous update of a
single node. Furthermore, most reprogramming mechanisms
do not care about security at all, or rely on expensive public
key cryptography.
Kulkarni and Wang propose a multihop reprogramming
service for wireless sensor networks which uses a sender selection
algorithm to avoid collisions <A href="41.html#9">[16]. Impala, a middleware
system for managing sensor systems is presented
by Liu and Martonosi <A href="41.html#9">[17]. Its modular architecture supports
updates to the running system. An application consists
of several modules which are independently transferred;
an update is complete if all its modules have been received.
Jeong and Culler introduce an efficient incremental network
programming mechanism <A href="41.html#9">[13]. Thanks to the usage of the
Rsync algorithm, only incremental changes to the new program
must be transferred.
A secure dissemination algorithm to distribute new program
releases among nodes is presented by Dutta et al. <A href="41.html#9">[7].
Program binaries are propagated as a sequence of data blocks
of which the first is authenticated with the private key of
114
the base station and the subsequent ones by means of a
hash chain. In order to improve the fault tolerance of the
sensor network, nodes use a grenade timer to reboot period-ically
. During the boot process neighboring nodes are asked
whether a new program release is available and if so, its
download is initiated.
DEFINITIONS
In this section, we define our assumptions regarding the
observation of nodes and the network communication model.
We specify the capabilities of a potential adversary, explain
what we consider a correct recover algorithm, and discuss
the requirements on the hard- and software of a sensor node.
2.1
Intrusion and Misbehaviour Detection
Troughout this paper, we assume that the network is divided
into N
C
so called observation clusters C
i
= (V
i
, E
i
),
0  i &lt; N
C
of size n, n = |V
i
|. Within a cluster each node
is connected to each other (v
i
, v
j
V
k
, v
i
= v
j
: {v
i
, v
j
}
E
k
) and observes the behaviour of its cluster neighbours.
For the actual monitoring of the neighbours an arbitrary
IDS can be used, as long as each node ends up with an
(individual) decision about whether a certain node behaves
correct or malicious. The set of malicious nodes in a cluster
is denoted by M
i
and their number by t, t = |M
i
|  n.
2.2
Network Model
In the following, p
s
(p
r
) denotes the probability that the
sending (receiving) of a message fails. Thus, for 0  p
s
, p
l
&lt;
1 the resulting probability for an unsuccessful transmission
(packet loss ratio, PLR) is
p
l
:= 1 - (1 - p
s
)(1 - p
r
) = p
s
+ p
r
+ p
s
p
r
Additionally, we assume that there exists a constant upper
bound
p
O(1) on the transmission time of a message.
2.3
Adversary Model
We consider an omnipresent but computationally bounded
adversary who can perform both outsider as well as insider
attacks. This means that a potential adversary is able to intercept
and create arbitrary messages but unable to decrypt
or authenticate messages for which he does not possess the
required keys. We further assume that nodes can be either
logically (i.e., by exploiting a software bug) or physically
captured. However, the time to compromise a node physically
is considered non-negligible (i.e., it takes some time to
move from node to node and to perform the physical manipulations
) and to not significantly decrease with the number
of already captured nodes.
2.4
Hard- and Software Requirements
To all presented recovery measures applies that they are
only applicable if at least the therefore needed systems of
the corrupt node ­ in the following denoted as the recovery
system ­ still work correctly. In order to achieve this, one
has to make sure that the recovery system is logically and,
if feasible, physically protected.
Logical Protection of the Recovery System
Logical protection means that it should not be possible for a
running application to prevent the execution of the recovery
procedures. That is, if the program code running on a node
has crashed or been corrupted by an adversary (e.g., by exploiting
a security hole), this should not affect the integrity
and availability of the recovery system.
One mechanism to achieve this is to set up a hardware
interrupt which cannot be suppressed or redirected by the
application and by locating the dedicated interrupt routine
in a write protected memory area. Consequently, on each
interrupt request, control is handed over to the immutable
interrupt routine an thus to the recovery system. A simple
variant of this mechanism in which a grenade timer period-ically
reboots the system and the bootloader is located in
read only memory (ROM) is used by Dutta et al. <A href="41.html#9">[7]. Another
approach would be to misuse some additionally available
MCUs <A href="41.html#9">[23], for example the ARM CPU on the ARM-based
Bluetooth module on the BTnode.
Some of these
MCUs are powerful enough to take on additional tasks like
monitoring the main MCUs activities or rewriting the application
memory. In case of the BTnode that extra MCU
is directly responsible for communication and thus it would
be guaranteed that it has access to all received packets as
well.
On more advanced systems, mechanisms as provided by
Intel's protected mode (e.g., isolated memory areas, privilege
levels, etc.) could be used to protect the recovery system
more efficiently. Current technologies such as ARM's
TrustZone <A href="41.html#9">[1] for embedded devices or Intel's LaGrande technology
<A href="41.html#9">[11] go even further and enable a comprehensive protection
of the CPU, memory, and peripherals from software
attacks.
Physical Protection of the Recovery System
The physical protection of current sensor node platforms
is very poor because of their focus on simple maintenance
<A href="41.html#9">[9]. However, although it is generally agreed that entirely
tamper-proof sensor nodes would be too expensive, current
trends in the hardware development of embedded devices indicate
that some level of physical protection will be available
in the near future <A href="41.html#9">[20, 15]. Security mechanisms regarding
the packaging of sensor nodes as, for instance, those proposed
by FIPS 140-2 level 2 <A href="41.html#9">[19] could already significantly
increase the cost for an adversary. For integrity and not
confidentiality is the main concern with the recovery module
, it has only to be protected against manipulations but
not against unintended disclosure or side-channel attacks.
In fact, it would be sufficient to have mechanisms which
render a node useless if the case of the recovery system was
opened; complete tamper resistance is not required.
2.5
Correct Node Recover Algorithms
A node recovery algorithm for a cluster C
i
= (V
i
, E
i
) is
considered correct if the following liveness and safety properties
hold:
L1 If all correct nodes (V
i
\ M
i
) accuse a node m  V
i
to
be faulty or malicious, its recovery process will finally
be initiated with high probability.
L2 Once the recovery process for a node m  V
i
has been
initiated, it will eventually terminate as long as there
remain at least k  1 correct nodes  V
i
\ M
i
.
S1 If no more than
n-1
3
correct nodes (i.e., a minority)
accuse another correct node v  V
i
\ M
i
the recovery
process will not be initiated.
115
S2 After the recovery process, a node m  V
i
must either
(i) be halted, (ii) contain the same program code as
before, or (iii) contain the correct program code.
The two liveness properties L1 and L2 ensure that each malicious
node is recovered if its aberrant behaviour is detected
by enough neighbours. Safety property S1 is required to
make sure that a node is only recovered if a majority of correct
nodes accuses it and property S2 ensures that things
are not worsened by applying the recovery process.
DISTRIBUTED NODE RECOVERY
In this section, we present a distributed node recovery
algorithm which is autonomously executed within an observation
cluster. The supported recovery measures are: node
shutdown, node restart, and program code update. As long
as the recovery module of an otherwise faulty or malicious
node is still intact, it is tried to recover it by restarting it or
updating its program code; or to at least eliminate its interfering
influence by turning it off. If a node does not respond
to any of these measures, it is still possible to logically expell
it; preferably by means of a reliable majority decision <A href="41.html#9">[22]
to avoid inconsistencies among the cluster members.
3.1
Description of the Recovery Procedure
The proposed recovery algorithm consists of two phases.
In the first, so called accusation phase, nodes accuse all
neighbours which are regarded as being malicious. If a node
is accused by at least two third of its neighbours it initiates
the second, so called recovery phase, during which the actual
countermeasures are executed. To simplify the cooperative
program code update, the program memory of a node is divided
into F frames f
i
, 0  i &lt; F of size f s. Additionally,
for each frame f
i
its corresponding hash value h
i
:= h(f
i
) is
computed.

Accusation Phase
Nodes which conclude that one of their neighbours behaves
maliciously, send it an authenticated accusation mes<A href="41.html#4">sage
<A href="41.html#4">1
<A href="41.html#4">.
The proposed countermeasure depends on the observed aberration
and can be either of type shutdown, reset, or update,
if the node should be halted, restarted, or its program code
updated, respectively. Accusation messages have to be ac-knowledged
and are resent up to r times otherwise.
1
For simplicity, it is assumed that nodes can accuse their
neighbours at any time. However, if the recovery module
is only active from time to time, nodes could of course also
actively ask for (pending) accusations.
In case that a program update is requested, the accusation
messages also include a list of the sender's F frame hash
values h
i
. They represent the current state of its program
memory and are required to deduce the correct program
code. Therefore, for each frame f
i
not only its hash value h
i
but also a counter c
i
, which is initialised with zero, is stored.
Upon reception of a accusation message, each included hash
value is compared to the already stored one and if they are
equal, c
i
is incremented by one. If they differ and c
i
&gt; 0 the
counter is decremented by one; otherwise (i.e., they are not
equal and c
i
= 0) the stored hash value is replaced with the
received value. This procedure ensures that, for 3t &lt; n - 1,
every h
i
will contain the hash value of the correct program
code frame after
2(n-1)
3
accusations have been received
(see Proof <A href="41.html#6">4).
Recovery Phase
When a node m has received
2(n-1)
3
accusations of a certain
recovery type, the corresponding measure is initiated.
In the non trivial case of a distributed program code update
, the correct program code has therefore to be down-loaded
from the neighboring nodes. Otherwise, the node is
just rebooted or shutdown and no further communication or
coordination is required.
The autonomous program code transfer is performed in
rounds of which each starts with the broadcasting of an authenticated
update request message by the accused node m.
Essentially, the message contains a list of so called frame
descriptors (u
i
, Q
i
), consisting of a node id u
i
and a set of
requested frame numbers Q
i
:= {r
0
, r
1
, . . . , r
|Q|-1
}. Upon
reception of a valid request, a node v seeks for descriptors
which contain its own id (i.e., u
i
= v). If present, for each
requested frame number r
j
Q
i
the corresponding program
code frame is sent back to m with an update message. All
received program code fragments f
i
, in turn, are verified by
m using the stored hash values h
i
. Valid code fragments are
copied into the program <A href="41.html#4">memory
<A href="41.html#4">2
and the frame marked as
updated. If for a duration of
round
no update messages arrive
although there are still some outstanding frames, a new
update request message is broadcasted and the next round
initiated. As soon as all frames have been received, the node
is rebooted and thus the new program code activated.
In order to distribute the transfer load equally among all
participating nodes and to ensure that the update procedure
terminates if at least one correct node is available, the
frame descriptors are determined as follows: First, the n - 1
participating nodes are ordered such that id(v
0
) &lt; id(v
1
) &lt;
. . . &lt; id(v
n-2
). Next, the F memory frames are divided into
n - 1 sectors of length l :=
F
n-1
. Finally, to each node one
such fragment is assigned per update round in a round robin
fashion. Thus, in round i node v
j
, is responsible for the segment
s := j + i mod (n - 1), that is, for the frames sl to
min((s + 1)l - 1, F - 1). In the first round, for example,
the first node is responsible for the first l frames, the second
node for the second l frames and so on. In the second round,
however, the assignment is rotated by one and thus the outstanding
frames of the first sector are now requested from
the second node. This process has to be continued until all
required frames have been received.
2
On most sensor node platforms, new code is not directly
written into program memory but into a therefore available
Flash memory and installed during a subsequent reboot.
116
Extensions and Optimisations
Even though not all but only the subset of modified program
code frames has to be requested, updating a node is
still a time consuming and expensive task. Consequently,
the amount of update load that a specific node can cause
should be restricted, for instance by limiting the number of
update messages that are sent to it. To further reduce the
load for the participating nodes, the F hash values h
i
in
an accusation message can be replaced by the hash value
h := h(h
0
||h
1
|| . . . ||h
F -1
).
Once the correct value h has
been determinded using the corresponding counter c in analogy
to the above mentioned algorithm, the actual hash values
can be requested from the neighbours in a second step
and verified with h. In order to decrease the total number
of required accusation messages, more than one recovery
measure per message should be allowed. Alternatively, the
measures could be hierarchically organised, having the type
update also counting as a reboot or shutdown request.

PROOF OF CORRECTNESS
In this section, we proof the correctness of the proposed
algorithm with respect to the specifications of section <A href="41.html#3">2.
Theorem 1. Given the network and adversary model specified
in section <A href="41.html#3">2, the proposed recovery algorithm is correct
and fulfils the properties L1, L2, S1, and S2 if the recovery
module of the accused node m is intact, if h() is a secure
hashfunction, and if less than one third of the participating
nodes are malicious (i.e., 3t &lt; n - 1).
In order to prove Theorem <A href="41.html#6">1 we have to show that the
properties L1, L2, S1, and S2 hold. We therefore first prove
some helper Lemmas.
Lemma 1. If all correct nodes accuse a node m, its recovery
process will be initiated with high probability.
Proof. The probability that less than
2(n-1)
3
accusations
are received is equal to the probability that more than
n-1
3
messages are either not sent or lost. Assuming that the t
malicious nodes do not participate in the distributed update,
at least
n-1
3
-t+1 accusations must get lost. Given 0  p
l
&lt;
1, the probability for this is  (p
r
l
)
n-1
3
-t+1
+ (p
r
l
)
n-1

-t+2

r
l
)
n-1

2(n-1)+3t

(p
r
l
)
n-1
3
-t+1
. It holds that c &gt; 1 :
r  1 such that
2(n-1)+3t
3
,,
p
n-1
3
-t+1
l
«
r
&lt; n
-c
. Thus, the
node m gets
2(n-1)
3
accusations w.h.p. and the recovery
process is initiated.
Lemma 2. Once the recovery process for a node m has
been initiated it will eventually terminate as long as there
remain at least k  1 correct nodes.
Proof. In order that a frame is updated in a specific
round, the dedicated request as well as its actual transmission
must succeed.
The probability that this is the case
is (1 - p
l
)
2
. With only one correct node (k = 1) the expected
number of update rounds per frame a can be described
as a Markov chain described by the expression a =
(a + 1)(1 - (1 - p
l
)
2
) + (1 - p
l
)
2
with the solution a =
1
(1-p
l
)
2
.
The overall expected number of rounds is thus
aF =
F
(1-p
l
)
2
O(1). In each round at most one request and
F updates are transmitted, leading to an upper bound for
its duration of (F + 1)
p
O(1). Altogether, the expected
worst case duration is
F (F +1)
(1-p
l
)
2

p
O(1).
Lemma 3. If no more than
n-1
3
correct nodes accuse another
correct node v  M the recovery process will not be
initiated.
Proof. From each node only one accusation is accepted
and thus the number of valid accusations is at most
n-1
3
+t &lt;
2(n-1)
3
.
Lemma 4. At the start of a program code update the target
node m has stored the correct hash value h
i
for all frames,
given that all correct nodes have loaded the same program
code.
Proof. Let's assume that there is a hash value h
i
which
is not correct when the program code update starts. As a
stored hash value is only substituted if the dedicated counter
c
i
is zero, the node must have received at least as many
wrong values as correct ones. From each node only one accusation
is accepted, thus of the a
2(n-1)
3
received values
at most t &lt;
n-1
3
are false.
It follows that at least
a - t &gt;
2(n-1)
3
n
-1
3
=
n-1
3
&gt; t values must be correct,
which contradicts the assumption that at least as many false
as correct hash values were received.
The properties L1, L2, and S1 are proven by Lemma <A href="41.html#6">1,
<A href="41.html#6">2, and <A href="41.html#6">3, respectively.
If the accused node is turned off
or restarted, property S2 holds by definition. Otherwise, if
the program code is updated, Lemma <A href="41.html#6">4 and property L2
guarantee that only correct code frames are installed and
that the procedure finally terminates.
EVALUATION
In this section we provide an analytical evaluation of the
proposed algorithm and present the findings of extensive
simulations as well as of a real implementation for the BTnodes
.
The evaluated metrics are: (a) number of update
rounds, (b) update load for the accused nodes, (c) update
load for the other participating nodes, and (d) update duration
.
5.1
Analytical Evaluation
Number of Update Rounds
In order to update a frame it is required that the dedicated
request as well as the actual frame itself are successfully
transmitted. The expected fraction of erroneous updates is
therefore 1 - (1 - p
l
)
2
. If one further assumes that the t
malicious nodes do not participate in the program update,
the fraction increases to 1 n
-1-t
n-1
(1 - p
l
)
2
. Thus, the expected
number of outstanding frames after the first and second
update round are E
f
(1) = F (1 n
-1-t
n-1
(1 - p
l
)
2
) and
E
f
(2) = E
f
(1)(1-n
-1-t
n-1
(1-p
l
)
2
) = F (1-n
-1-t
n-1
(1-p
l
)
2
)
2
,
respectively. In general, the expected number of outstanding
frames after i &gt; 0 rounds is:
E
f
(i)
=
E

(i - 1)

)
2
«
=
F
,,
1 - n - 1 - t
n - 1
(1 - p

)
2
«
i
Consequently, the expected number of update rounds is
E
r

log(0.5) - log(F )
log(1 n
-1-t
n-1
(1 - p
l
)
2
)
For reliable connections (p
l
= 0) we get E
r

log(0.5)-log(F )
log(1/3)

O(1).
In a worst case scenario a continuous sequence of
frames is assigned to the t malicious nodes and thus at least
t + 1, that is O(t) = O(n) rounds are required. Moreover,
for a fixed p
l
, the expected number of rounds is (almost)
independent of the cluster size n as

fixed t, 0  t &lt;

E

is the expected number of addressed nodes and
E

requested frames per node.
Update Duration
The total number of sent messages E
m
is bound by (F +
1)E
r
O(E
r
) as there are only one request and no more
that F update messages per round.
Thus, the expected
value of E
m
is in O(1) for reliable connections and in O(n)
in the worst case. More precisely, the expected number of
messages is given by

Neglecting the delays caused by the involved software routines

achieved by considering the overall transfer time and the
delays caused by the round timeouts. The expected time to
transfer all messages is

Implementation
In addition to the above mentioned simulations, the algorithm
was also implemented for the BTnodes, a wireless
sensor platform running NutOS <A href="41.html#9">[3]. A detailed description
of the created software is omitted due to space reasons but
can be found in <A href="41.html#9">[22]. The implementation was evaluated by
randomly distributing a cluster of 10 nodes in a field of 20
x 20 m, whereupon each node in turn initiated a complete
program update. Altogether, over 100 recovery procedures
where measured.

has for a fixed packet loss ratio almost no negative impact
on the evaluated metrics, showing that the algorithm itself
scales well. Furthermore, the results show that the update
algorithm is fair and equally distributes the update load over
all participating nodes.
Update Rounds and Update Duration
Whilst the expected number of update rounds (see Figure
<A href="41.html#7">2) is only of secondary importance, the update duration (see
Figure <A href="41.html#7">3) is of major interest for the feasibility of the algorithm
. The faster a node recovery is completed, the sooner
the network is operable again. Even though the update duration
almost triples from 50 to 150 s if the packet loss ratio
increases from 0 to 40 percent, it is still in a range which
most WSN application should be able to cope with.
Update Load
In a cluster of 10 nodes the update load for the accused node
(see Figure <A href="41.html#8">4) is 0.5 to 3.5 kByte for 0  p
l
0.4 and thus
considerably smaller than for the other participating nodes
(see Figure <A href="41.html#8">5) with a load of 12 to 24 kByte. However, the
latter is, as expected, inverse proportional to the cluster size
(see Figure <A href="41.html#8">7): the larger a cluster and the lower the number
of malicious nodes, the smaller the expected update load per
participating node.

Implementation
In the experiments conducted with the BTnode implementation
, the average number of update rounds was five, the
update duration about 100 s (  10 s), and the load for
the participating nodes about 15 kByte (  1 kByte). Applied
to the analytical model this would mean that the gross
packet loss ratio was roughly 20%.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented an autonomous and distributed
recovery algorithm for sensor networks. The algorithm allows
for bringing malicious or failed nodes back into normal
operation or, at least, for securely shutting them down. Particularly
in remote or unwieldy areas, such as deserts, the
bottom of the sea, mountains, or even on planets in outer
space, where redeployment is expensive and sensor nodes
cannot easily be exchanged or maintained, the application
of a node recovery system is most likely to extend the lifetime
of the whole network.
The results of the simulation and analytical analysis were
confirmed by the real BTnode implementation. They show
that recovering sensor nodes is ­ as any form of reprogramming
­ an expensive, though feasible task. Moreover, the
proposed program code update algorithm is not only prov-120
ably secure but also fair and robust. It distributes the update
load equally over all participating nodes and terminates
as long as at least one of the nodes remains correct.
To all presented recovery measures applies that they are
only applicable if at least the therefore needed systems of
the corrupt node still work correctly. However, although it is
generally agreed that entirely tamper-proof sensor nodes are
too expensive, current trends in the hardware development
of embedded devices indicate that at least some logical and
physical protection (e.g., CPUs which support isolated memory
areas or automatic memory erason if a node is tempered
with) will be available in the near future. We discussed how
these upcoming technologies can be exploited to protect the
recovery mechanisms of a sensor node and what is already
feasible with existing systems.
