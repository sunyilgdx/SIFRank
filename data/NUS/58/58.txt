COOLCAT: An entropy-based algorithm for categorical clustering
ABSTRACT
In this paper we explore the connection between clustering
categorical data and entropy: clusters of similar poi lower
entropy than those of dissimilar ones. We use this connection
to design an incremental heuristic algorithm, COOLCAT
, which is capable of efficiently clustering large data sets
of records with categorical attributes, and data streams. In
contrast with other categorical clustering algorithms published
in the past, COOLCAT's clustering results are very
stable for different sample sizes and parameter settings. Also,
the criteria for clustering is a very intuitive one, since it is
deeply rooted on the well-known notion of entropy. Most
importantly, COOLCAT is well equipped to deal with clustering
of data streams (continuously arriving streams of data
point) since it is an incremental algorithm capable of clustering
new points without having to look at every point that
has been clustered so far. We demonstrate the efficiency and
scalability of COOLCAT by a series of experiments on real
and synthetic data sets.

same group, or cluster, are more similar among themselves
than to those in other clusters. Clustering of categorical
attributes (i.e., attributes whose domain is not numeric) is
a difficult, yet important task: many fields, from statistics
to psychology deal with categorical data.
In spite of its
importance, the task of categorical clustering has received
scant attention in the KDD community as of late, with only
a handful of publications addressing the problem ([18, 14,
12]).
Much of the published algorithms to cluster categorical
data rely on the usage of a distance metric that captures
the separation between two vectors of categorical attributes,
such as the Jaccard coefficient. In this paper, we present
COOLCAT (the name comes from the fact that we reduce
the entropy of the clusters, thereby "cooling" them), a novel
method which uses the notion of entropy to group records.
We argue that a classical notion such as entropy is a more
natural and intuitive way of relating records, and more importantly
does not rely in arbitrary distance metrics. COOLCAT
is an incremental algorithm that aims to minimize
the expected entropy of the clusters. Given a set of clusters
, COOLCAT will place the next point in the cluster
where it minimizes the overall expected entropy. COOLCAT
acts incrementally, and it is capable to cluster every
new point without having to re-process the entire set. Therefore
, COOLCAT is suited to cluster data streams (contin-uosly
incoming data points) [2].
This makes COOLCAT
applicable in a large variety of emerging applications such
as intrusion detection, and e-commerce data.
This paper is set up as follows. Section 2 offers the background
and relationship between entropy and clustering, and
formulates the problem. Section 3 reviews the related work.
Section 4 describes COOLCAT, our algorithm. Section 5
presents the experimental evidence that demonstrates the
advantages of COOLCAT. Finally, Section 6 presents conclusions
and future work.
BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM FOR-MULATION
In this section, we present the background of entropy and
clustering and formulate the problem.
2.1
Entropy and Clustering
Entropy is the measure of information and uncertainty of
a random variable [28]. Formally, if X is a random variable,
S(X) the set of values that X can take, and p(x) the prob-582
ability function of X, the entropy E(X) is defined as shown
in Equation 1.
E(X) =
x
S(X)
p(x)log(p(x))
(1)
The entropy of a multivariate vector ^
x =
{X
1
,
· · · , X
n
}
can be computed as shown in Equation 2, where p(^
x) =
p(x

· · · , x
n
) is the multivariate probability distribution.

Entropy is sometimes referred to as a measure of the
amount of "disorder" in a system. A room with socks strewn
all over the floor has more entropy than a room in which
socks are paired up, neatly folded, and placed in one side of
your sock and underwear drawer.
2.2
Problem formulation
The problem we are trying to solve can be formulated as
follows. Given a data set D of N points ^

, where
each point is a multidimensional vector of d categorical attributes

p

), and given an integer k, we
would like to separate the points into k groups C
1
,
· · · , C
k
,
or clusters, in such a way that we minimize the entropy of
the whole arrangement. Unfortunately, this problem is NP-Complete
, and moreover, difficult to approximate [13]. In
fact, the problem is NP-Complete for any distance function
d(x, y), defined over pairs of points x, y, such that the function
maps pairs of points to real numbers (and hence, our
entropy function qualifies), therefore we need to resort to
heuristics to solve it.
We first have to resolve the issue of what we mean by the
"whole entropy of the system." In other words, we have
to make our objective function clear. We aim to minimize
the expected entropy, whose expression is shown in Equation
3, where E(C
1
),
· · · , E(C
k
), represent the entropies of
each cluster, C
i
denotes the points assigned to cluster i,
C
i
D, with the property that C

i, j
= 1, .., k i = j. The symbol

· · · , C

}
represents the clustering.

E(
C) =

( |C

|
|D| (E(C

)))
(3)
This function, as we will see later, allows us to implement
an incremental algorithm that can effectively deal with
large datasets, since we do not need to look at the entire set
of points to decide about the entropy of an arrangement.
Rather, we will be able to decide for each point, how it
would affect the entropy of each of the existing clusters if
placed in each one of them.
The solution we propose in this paper (and present in Section
4) is a heuristic based in finding a set of initial clusters
(using the entropic criteria), and then incrementally (greed-ily
) add points to the clusters according to a criteria that
minimizes Equation 3.
Furthermore, we make a simplification in the computation
of entropy of a set of records. We assume independence of
the attributes of the record, transforming Equation 2 into
Equation 5.
In other words, the joint probability of the
combined attribute values becomes the product of the prob-members

=
{"blue", "light"}, and v
3
=
{"red",

}, and we want to form two clusters with them.
Figure 1 shows all the possible arrangements, with the entropy
of each cluster, and the expected entropy in each arrangement
. As we can see, the minimum expected entropy
is that of arrangement 1, which obviously is the correct way
of clustering the records (using two clusters).
Even though the assumption of attribute independence
is not true in every data set, it proves to work very well
in practice (as shall be shown in the experimental section
of this paper). Moreover, in the cases we can demonstrate
that there is a correlation between two or more attributes of
the data set, we can always change the data points by creating
attributes that reflect these correlations and then apply
Equation 5 to compute the join entropy. For instance, if the
data set is composed of records of attributes A, B, C, D, E, F
and we know that (A, B), (A, C) and (E, F ) are correlated.
we can convert the data set into one having records with
attributes AB, AC, D, EF and compute the entropy assuming
that these new attributes are independent. Notice that
for the grouped attributes, we are in effect computing their
joint probabilities. The correlations between attributes can
be easily found by techniques such as the Chi-Square and
likelihood ratio tests. In our experimental experience, the
gains obtained by doing this are small enough to justify the
usage of the independence assumption.
2.3
Expected entropy and the Minimum Description
Length principle
The Minimum Description Length principle (MDL) [26,
27] recommends choosing the model that minimizes the sum
of the model's algorithmic complexity and the description of
the data with respect to that model. This principle is widely
583
used to compare classifiers (see [23]) but it has not been used
much to deal with clustering.
Formally, the complexity of the model can be stated as
shown in Equation 6, where K() indicates the complexity, h
is the model, and D denotes the data set. The term K(h)
denotes the complexity of the model, or model encoding,
while K(D using h) is the complexity of the data encoding
with respect to the chosen model.
K(h, D) = K(h) + K(D using h)
(6)
Consider first the term K(h). To encode the model, we
need to encode for each cluster the probability distribution
for the attribute values. This can be done by encoding the
number of times each attribute value appears in the cluster,
and the number of points in each cluster. Assuming that
there are d attributes in the data, and that attribute A
j
can assume v
j
different values. As usual, k represents the
number of clusters in the model. K(h) can be written as
shown in Equation 7. In each cluster i, we need to encode
c
i
=
d-1
j=0
v
j
values. So, the total number of values we
need to encode is
k-1
i=0
c
i
= k, where  is a constant. We
also need to encode the number of points in each cluster, or
k values. The number of bits needed to encode the number
of times each attribute value occurs in the cluster, or the
number of points in a cluster is equal to log(
|D|), since the
maximum number for these values is the size of the entire
data set. Therefore K(h) is a linear function of k, with 
a constant that represents all the contributions described
above.
K(h) = klog(
|D|)
(7)
On the other hand, the encoding of the data given the
model can be stated as shown in Equation 8.
Once the
probabilities of occurrence of each attribute value in each
cluster are known, an optimal code (Huffman) can be chosen
to represent each attribute value in the cluster. Each point
is simply represented by the encoding of its attributes' values
. The optimal code is achieved by giving to each value a
number of bits proportional to log(Pijl), where P (ijl) is the
probability that the l value of attribute j occurs in cluster i.
The second term in the equation simply indicates the membership
of all the points, needing log(k) for the encoding of
the individual memberships.

(8)
Noticing that the first term of Equation 8 is simply the
expected entropy of the clustering, we can write K(h, D) as
shown in Equation 9. Notice that for a fixed k, the MDL
principle indicates that the best model can be found by minimizing
the expected entropy of the clustering, which is pre-cisely
our goal.
K(h, D) = log(
|D|) + Dlog(k) + ¯

2.4
Evaluating clustering results
A frequent problem one encounters when applying clustering
algorithms in practice is the difficulty in evaluating the
solutions. Different clustering algorithms (and sometimes
multiple applications of the same algorithm using slight variations
of initial conditions or parameters) result in very different
solutions, all of them looking plausible. This stems
from the fact that there is no unifying criteria to define clusters
, and more often than not, the final clusters found by the
algorithm are in fact the ones that correspond to the criteria
used to drive the algorithm. Methods to evaluate whether
or not the structure found is a property of the data set and
not one imposed by the algorithm are needed.
Authors have pondered about good ways to validate clusters
found by algorithms (e.g., see [21, 1]). Two widely used
methods are the following:
· Significance Test on External Variables This technique
calls for the usage of significance tests that compare
the clusters on variables not used to generate them.
One way of doing this is to compute the entropy of
the solution using a variable that did not participate
in the clustering. (A class attribute.) The entropy of
an attribute C in a cluster C
k
is computed as shown
in Equation 10, where V
j
denotes one of the possible
values that C can take. The evaluation is performed
by computing the expected entropy (taken into consideration
the cluster sizes). The smaller the value of
E(C
k
), the better the clustering fares.
E(C
k
) =
j
P (C = V
j
)logP (C = V
j
)
(10)
· The category utility function The category utility (CU)
function [15] attempts to maximize both the probability
that two objects in the same cluster have attribute
values in common and the probability that objects
from different clusters have different attributes. The
expression to calculate the expected value of the CU
function is shown in Equation 11, where P (A
i
= V
ij
|C
k
)
is the conditional probability that the attribute i has
the value V
ij
given the cluster C
k
, and P (A
i
= V
ij
)
is the overall probability of the attribute i having the
value V
ij
(in the entire set).
The function aims to
measure if the clustering improves the likelihood of
similar values falling in the same cluster. Obviously,
the higher the value of CU, the better the clustering
fares.

We have used both techniques in validating our results,
as shall be seen in the experimental section.
2.5
Number of clusters
The issue of choosing the number of clusters is one common
to all clustering methods, and our technique is no exception
. Many methods have been proposed for determining
the right number of clusters (e.g.,[4, 9]). Unfortunately
many of these methods (e.g., [4]) assume that it is possible
to compute a centroid for each cluster, which in categorical
data is not easy. We consider this issue out of the scope of
584
this paper since we plan to examine good ways of selecting
the optimal number of clusters in the context of our metric.
RELATED WORK
Clustering is an extensively researched area not only by
data mining and database researchers [31, 11, 17, 18, 3], but
also by people in other disciplines [10]. Among the numerical
clustering algorithms, ENCLUS [6] uses entropy as a
criteria to drive the algorithm. However, ENCLUS follows
a completely different algorithm to our approach, dividing
the hyperspace recursively. For each subspace, ENCLUS estimates
its density and entropy and determines if it satisfies
the goodness criteria: its entropy has to be lower than a
threshold. However, it is not possible to translate either the
algorithm or the relationships to the area of categorical clustering
, since the notion of density has no intuitive meaning
when the attributes are categorical. In a recent paper [16],
the authors use Renyi's definition of entropy [25] to define
a clustering evaluation function that measures the distance
between clusters as the information potential [24] between
them. Using this function, they describe an algorithm that,
starting with a random placing of points in clusters, perturbs
the placement until the improvement on the information potential
is not appreciable. This algorithm, however, cannot
scale to large data sets since it requires all points to perform
the calculation of the distance.
In the area of clustering categorical records, a few recent
publications are worth mentioning. In [19], the authors
address the problem of clustering transactions in a market
basket database by representing frequent item sets as hyper-edges
in a weighted hypergraph. The weight of the graph is
computed as the average of the confidences for all possible
association rules that can be generated from the item set.
Then, a hypergraph partitioning algorithm is employed to
partition the items, minimizing the weight of the cut hyper-edges
. The algorithm does not produce a clustering of the
transactions and it is not obvious how to obtain one from
the item clusters. A related paper by Gibson et al [14] also
treats categorical clustering as hypergraph partitioning, but
uses a less combinatorial approach to solving it, based on
non-linear dynamical systems.
CACTUS [12], is an agglomerative algorithm that uses the
author's definitions of support, strong connection and similarity
to cluster categorical data. Support for an attribute
value pair (a
i
, a
j
), where a
i
is in the domain of attribute
A
i
and a
j
in the domain of attribute A
j
is defined as the
number of tuples that have these two values. The two attributes
a
i
, a
j
are strongly connected if their support exceeds
the value expected under the attribute-independence.
This concept is then extended to sets of attributes. A cluster
is defined as a region of attributes that are pairwise
strongly connected, no sub-region has the property, and its
support exceeds the expected support under the attribute-independence
assumption.
ROCK [18] computes distances between records using the
Jaccard coefficient.
Using a threshold, it determines, for
each record, who are its neighbors. For a given point p, a
point q is a neighbor of p if the Jaccard coefficient J(p, q)
exceeds the threshold. Then, it computes the values of a
matrix LIN K, in which the entries link(p, q) are the number
of common neighbors between p and q. The algorithm
then proceeds to cluster the records in an agglomerative way,
trying to maximize for the k clusters (k is a predefined integer
) the function

The choice of f () is critical in defining the fitness of the
clusters formed the the ROCK algorithm, and, as the authors
point out, the function is dependent on the data set
as well as on the kind of cluster the user is interested in. We
feel that choosing the function is a delicate and difficult task
for users that may be a roadblock to using ROCK efficiently.
Snob [29, 30] is an unsupervised learning algorithm based
on the notion of Minimum Message Length (MML). MML
is an information theoretic criterion for parameter estimation
and model selection. Although MML is similar to the
MDL criterion of Rissanen, MML is a Bayesian criterion
and therefore uses an a-priori distribution of parameter values
. Snob is in the category of mixture model algorithms
[22]. Snob is iterative in nature and therefore does not scale
with large data sets. Moreover, contrary to COOLCAT, it
is difficult to envision how Snob can be used to cluster data
streams. AUTOCLASS [5] also uses mixture models and
Bayesian criteria to cluster data sets. Again, AUTOCLASS
does not scale well with large data sets.
OUR ALGORITHM
Our entropy-based algorithm, COOLCAT, consists of two
steps: initialization and incremental step.
4.1
Initialization
The initialization step "bootstraps" the algorithm, finding
a suitable set of clusters out of a sample S, taken from the
data set (
|S| &lt;&lt; N), where N is the size of the entire data
set. We first find the k most "dissimilar" records from the
sample set by maximizing the minimum pairwise entropy
of the chosen points. We start by finding the two points
ps
1
, ps
2
that maximize E(ps
1
, ps
2
) and placing them in two
separate clusters (C
1
, C
2
), marking the records (this takes
O(
|S|
2
)). From there, we proceed incrementally, i.e., to find
the record we will put in the j-th cluster, we choose an unmarked
point ps
j
that maximizes min
i=1,..,j-1
(E(ps
i
, ps
j
)).
The rest of the sample unmarked points (
|S| - k), as well
as the remaining points (outside the sample), are placed in
the clusters using the incremental step.
We are interested in determining the size of the sample
that guarantees with high probability the existence in the
sample of at least one member of each cluster, given the
number of clusters. In [17], the authors address the same
problem and use Chernoff bounds[7] to bound the size of the
sample given an estimate of the size of the smallest cluster
with respect to the average size (
|D|
k
), and the confidence
level  for the probability of finding at least a member of
each cluster. The estimate of the size of the smallest cluster
with respect to the average size is given in the form of a
parameter  =
|D|
k
m
, where m is the size of the smallest
cluster. The parameter  is then a number greater than
1. The bound on the size of the sample is then given by
Equation 12.
s = k + klog( 1
) + k
(log( 1
))
2
+ 2log( 1
)
(12)
It is important to remark that Equation 12 does not
depend on the size of the data set, which makes the bound

very favorable for larger sets (and unfavorable for small ones,
but this is not a problem since for small sets we can simply
use the entire set as a sample).
4.2
Incremental Step
After the initialization, we process the remaining records
of the data set (the rest of the sample and points outside
the sample) incrementally, finding a suitable cluster for each
record. This is done by computing the expected entropy
that results of placing the point in each of the clusters and
selecting the cluster for which that expected entropy is the
minimum. We proceed in the incremental step by bringing
a buffer of points to main memory and clustering them one
by one.
The order of processing points has a definite impact on
the quality of the clusters obtained. It is possible that a
point that seems a good fit for a cluster at a given point
in time, becomes a poor fit as more points are clustered.
In order to reduce this effect, we enhanced the heuristic by
re-processing a fraction of the points in the batch. After a
batch of points is clustered, we select a fraction m of points
in the batch that can be considered the worst fit for the clusters
they were put in. We proceed to remove these points
from their clusters and re-cluster them. The way we figure
out how good a fit a point is for the cluster where it landed
originally, is by keeping track of the number of occurrences
of each of its attributes' values in that cluster. That is, at
the end of the batch, we know the values of q
ij
, for each
record i in the batch and each attribute j, where q
ij
represent
the number of times that the value V
ij
appears in the
cluster where i was placed. We convert these numbers into
probabilities by dividing q
ij
by the cluster size (i.e.,
C
l
,
where C
l
is the cluster where i was placed). Let us call these
numbers p
ij
. For each record, we can compute a fitting probability
p
i
=
j
(p
ij
). Notice that the lower the p
i
is, the
worst fit the record is in that cluster (we can say that the
global combination of attributes is not very common in the
cluster). We then sort records according to p
i
and select the
m records in the batch with lowest p
i
as the records to be
reprocessed. Each re-processed record is placed in the cluster
that minimizes the expected entropy (as done originally
in the incremental step).
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Our experiments were run in a DELL server equipped
with a Pentium III running at 800 MHz, and 1 Gigabyte of
main memory, running Red Hat Linux 2.2.14. We used two
kinds of data sets: real data sets (for evaluating the quality
of our algorithm) and synthetic data sets (for the evaluation
of scalability). The experiments were conducted using the
following datasets (plus a synthetically generated data set
to test the scalability of the algorithm).
· Archaeological data set
Our first data set is a hypothetical collection of human
tombs and artifacts from an archaeological site. Although
the data set is not "real," it is realistic enough
and so we include it in this section. It has also the
property of being small, so brute force can be used
to find the optimal clustering. The data set is taken
from [1] The first attribute (not used for clustering
but for verification) indicates the sex (M for male, F
for female) of the individuals buried. The other eight
attributes are binary (1 present, 0 non-present), and
represent artifacts types (e.g., ceramics, bracelets, arrow
points) that were found (or not found) in the tomb.
· Congressional votes This data set was obtained from
the UCI KDD Archive ([20]) and contains the United
States Congressional Voting Records for the year 1984.
Each record contains a Congressman's votes on 16 issues
. All the attributes are boolean ("yes" or "no"),
with a few of the votes containing missing values. We
decided to treat missing values as another domain value
for the attribute. A classification field with the labels
"Democrat," or "Republican" is provided for each
record, which are not used for clustering, but can be
loosely used for quality measuring. (Some congress-men
"crossed" parties to vote.) There are 435 records
in the set (267 Democrats and 168 Republicans).
· KDD Cup 1999 data This data set can be obtained
from the UCI Archive [20], and was used for the the
Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining Tools Competition. This database contains a
standard set of network audit data, which includes a
wide variety of simulated intrusions. Each record, corresponding
to a connection, contains 42 features, some
of them categorical, and the rest continuous variables.
We transformed the continuous variables in categorical
by a simple process of discretization: we computed
the median of each attribute, and assigned any value
below and including the median a label "0," while the
rest of the values were assigned a label "1." There are
many intrusion data sets in the repository, some of
them to be used as training sets and some as test sets.
We utilized the set that corresponds to 10% of the
training data. In this set, records have an extra attribute
(class), labeled with a "1" if the connection is
part of an attack, or a "0" if it is not. We use this
attribute for the evaluation of external entropy (not in
the clustering process).

data set is small, so we believed that the clustering could effectively
separate the two sexes). We conducted experiments
with the original data set (which we label "independent"),
and a modified data set in which we grouped attributes in
the following way: (1), (24), (26), (34), (35), (46), (78), to reflect
the correlations found among the attributes of the set
(found by using a Likelihood ratio test). However, we only
report the results for independent data, since the correlated
set results are essentially the same. (The same phenomena
was observed in the other experiments.) We also conducted
"brute force" experiments, in which we found the optimum
clustering, i.e., that for which the expected entropy was the
minimum.
We did this to compare how well our heuristic
(COOLCAT) performed. We also report in the table
the best results found by ROCK (which have to be found
by varying the parameter  over a range of values). The
results shown in Figure 3 show that the expected entropy
function does an excellent job in clustering this data. The
results obtained by COOLCAT (in terms of CU , and external
entropy with respect to the variable sex, which is
not used in the clustering), and expected entropy are the
same obtained by the brute force (optimal) approach. In
all cases, both the CU function and the external entropy
of the COOLCAT solutions are better than those found for
the best ROCK solution. Particularly encouraging is the
fact that the external entropy for the variable SEX (which
the authors of the data set indicated as the one being more
correlated with the clusters), is 0 in all the COOLCAT solutions
, so a perfect separation is achieved. (ROCK's solution
does not achieve this, resulting in a high external entropy.)
In this data set, the re-processing step does not have any
effect, as seen by the fact that the results are the same for
all the values of m. This is attributed to the size of the data
set (only 20 records). Both COOLCAT and ROCK took
0.01 seconds to find a solution for this data set.

Congressional Voting results
Figure 4 summarizes the results obtained by COOLCAT
in the Congressional Voting records (no grouping of attributes
was performed), for three values of m. The results obtained
for various sample sizes are extremely stable. The CU values
for the clusterings obtained with COOLCAT are, in
all the cases superior to the one obtained by ROCK. The
values show no fluctuations on our results as m changes,
while the value for CU is 11% better than ROCK's value.
The external entropy for the COOLCAT solutions is slightly
better than the value in ROCK's solution. The buffer size
(batch) in this experiment was 100 records, making the num-Alg

The running time of COOLCAT is significantly better than
the one for ROCK (a decrease of 45% in the slowest case,
m = 20%, of COOLCAT).
5.3
KDD Cup 1999 data set
Since we did not have explicit knowledge of how many
clusters we could find in this data set, we decided to find
clusterings for many k values, and report, in each case, the
expected entropy, external entropy (with respect to the attribute
that denotes whether the record is an attack or not),
and CU . The results are shown in the form of a graph in
Figure 5.
In the figure, the left hand side scale is used
for expected entropy and CU , while the right hand side is
used for external entropy (the values of external entropy are
between 0 and 1, while the other parameters have larger
ranges). The figure shows that all the parameters tend to
an asymptotic limit as k grows. The saturation starts to
occur in the value k = 10, which exhibits an external entropy
of 0.09, which indicates that most of the clusters are
"inhabited" by either attack records or attack-free records.
In other words, the clustering achieves a good separation of
the points. The experiments were conducted using a sample
size of 1,000 points, which guarantees a level of confidence
of 95% (for  = 10).
5.4
Synthetic data set
We used a synthetic data generator ([8]) to generate data
sets with different number of records and attributes. We
used these data sets to test the scalability of COOLCAT.
The results are shown in the graph of Figure 7, where the
y-axis shows the execution time of COOLCAT in seconds,
and the x-axis the number of records (in multiples of 10
3
),
for four different number of attributes (A = 5, 10, 20, 40).
In all the cases, COOLCAT behaves linearly with respect to
the number of records, due to the incremental nature of the
algorithm (it processes each record in the data set at most
twice: those that are selected for re-processing are clustered
twice, the rest only once; moreover, points are brought from
disk to memory only once). We used for these experiments
an m equal to 20%, and a buffer size of 300 records. Notice
that in this experiment, we do not report running times for
ROCK. The reason for this is that ROCK is designed to
be a main memory algorithm. In [18], the authors make it
explicit that ROCK deals with large data sets by using random
sampling (not by looking at the entire set). Therefore,
it would have been unfair to compare COOLCAT's running
times with those of ROCK (over samples of the sets).
We performed another experiment with synthetic data

sets generated by [8]. In this experiment, each synthetic
set contained 8,124 records of 23 attributes each. Twenty
two of the attributes are used for clustering and one (Indx)
for the evaluation of external entropy. Each data set was
generated using 21 different types of rules. A rule involves
12 attributes. An example of the rules used is: A = c&C =
a&D = b&K = c&N = a&O = c&Q = b&R = c&S =
c&T = b&U = b
Indx = r
1
. This rule says that when
the 11 attributes on the left hand side take the values shown,
the attribute Indx takes the value r
1
. Every record obeys
one of the rules. Two sets were generated, using different
probability distributions for the rules. In the first one (uniform
), every rule is used in the same number of records in
the data set. (In other words the number of records that
obey a particular rule is equal to the size of the data set
divided by 21.) In the normal distribution, the populations
are distributed following a Gaussian distribution (some rules
receive more records than others). The 23rd attribute takes
the value of the rule number (rule index).
The external
entropy is calculated using this attribute (which does not
participate in the clustering). Figure 6 shows the evaluation
of clusters obtained by COOLCAT over different synthetic
data sets.
The table shows also the results obtained by
using ROCK. As we can see, COOLCAT results are significantly
better than those obtained by ROCK for both data
sets. Particularly significant is the fact that the external
entropy for the COOLCAT solutions in the Uniform case
with m = 10%, 20% are 0, indicating a perfect separation
of rules. The values for other cases are extremely close to
0 as well. As expected, re-processing (increasing m) helps
in finding a better clustering. However, the impact is more
marked when going from no re-processing (m = 0) to re-processing
10% of the points, leveling out from then on.
The running times of COOLCAT are more than one order
of magnitude smaller than those of ROCK.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have introduced a new categorical clustering
algorithm, COOLCAT, based in the notion of entropy
. The algorithm groups points in the data set trying
to minimize the expected entropy of the clusters. The ex-Dist

perimental evaluation supports our claim that COOLCAT
is an efficient algorithm, whose solutions are stable for different
samples (and sample sizes) and it is scalable for large
data sets (since it incrementally adds points to the initial
clusters). We have evaluated our results using category utility
function, and the external entropy which determines if
the clusters have significance with respect to external variables
(i.e., variables not used in the clustering process). In
our comparisons with ROCK, COOLCAT always shows a
small advantage in terms of the quality measures (CU and
external entropy). However, the real advantage of COOLCAT
resides in the fact that ROCK is extremely difficult to
tune (finding the right ), while COOLCAT's behavior to
its only parameter (m) is extremely stable: small values of
m are sufficient to obtain a good result. In the largest data
set for which we compared both techniques (Mushrooms),
COOLCAT had a significantly better running time.
The incremental nature of COOLCAT makes it possible
to apply the algorithm to data streams, and as the results in
scalability show, the algorithm can cope with large volumes
of data. We are currently doing research in tracking evolving
clusters using COOLCAT.
