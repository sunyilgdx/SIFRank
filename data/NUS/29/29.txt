An Analytical Model Based on G/M/1 with Self-Similar Input to Provide End-to-End QoS in 3G Networks
ABSTRACT
The dramatic increase in demand for wireless Internet access has 
lead to the introduction of new wireless architectures and systems 
including 3G, Wi-Fi and WiMAX.  3G systems such as UMTS and 
CDMA2000 are leaning towards an all-IP architecture for 
transporting IP multimedia services, mainly due to its scalability 
and promising capability of inter-working heterogeneous wireless 
access networks. During the last ten years, substantial work has 
been done to understand the nature of wired IP traffic and it has 
been proven that IP traffic exhibits self-similar properties and 
burstiness over a large range of time scales. Recently, because of 
the large deployment of new wireless architectures, researchers 
have focused their attention towards understanding the nature of 
traffic carried by different wireless architecture and early studies 
have shown that wireless data traffic also exhibits strong long-range
dependency. Thus, the classical tele-traffic theory based on a 
simple Markovian process cannot be used to evaluate the 
performance of wireless networks. Unfortunately, the area of 
understanding and modeling of different kinds of wireless traffic is 
still immature which constitutes a problem since it is crucial to 
guarantee tight bound QoS parameters to heterogeneous end users 
of the mobile Internet. In this paper, we make several contributions 
to the accurate modeling of wireless IP traffic by presenting a 
novel analytical model that takes into account four different 
classes of self-similar traffic. The model consists of four queues 
and is based on a G/M/1 queueing system. We analyze it on the 
basis of priority with no preemption and find exact packet delays. 
To date, no closed form expressions have been presented for 
G/M/1 with priority.

INTRODUCTION
During the past decade, researchers have made significant efforts 
to understand the nature of Internet traffic and it has been proven 
that Internet traffic exhibits self-similar properties. The first 
study, which stimulated research on self-similar traffic, was 
based on measurements of Ethernet traffic at Bellcore [1]. 
Subsequently, the self-similar feature has been discovered in 
many other types of Internet traffic including studies on 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [2, 3], WWW traffic [4], 
VBR video [5] and Signaling System No 7 [6]. Deeper studies 
into the characteristics of Internet traffic has discovered and 
investigated various properties such as self-similarity [7], long-range
dependence [8] and scaling behavior at small time-scale 
[9]. The references [10, 11] provide two extensive bibliographies 
on self-similarity and long-range dependence research covering 
both theoretical and applied papers on the subject. 
Concurrently, over the past few years, we have witnessed a 
growing popularity of Third Generation Systems (3G), which 
have been designed to provide high-speed data services and 
multimedia applications over mobile personal communication 
networks. The Universal Mobile Telecommunication System 
(UMTS) is the predominant global standard for 3G developed by 
Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [12]. The UMTS 
architecture is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of two service 
domains, a Circuit Switched (CS) service domain and a Packet 
Switched (PS) service domain, which is of interest in this paper. 
In the PS service domain, a UMTS network connects to a public 
data network (PDN) through Serving GPRS Support node 
(SGSN) and Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN). 3GPP has 
defined four different QoS classes for UMTS; (1) Conversational 
(2) Interactive (3) Streaming and (4) Background, conversational 
being the most delay-sensitive and background the least delay 
sensitive class [12]. 
With the increasing demand of Internet connectivity and the 
flexibility and wide deployment of IP technologies, there has 
emerged a paradigm shift towards IP-based solutions for wireless 
networking [13]. Several Wireless IP architectures have been 
proposed [17-23] based on three main IP QoS models, IntServ 
[14], DiffServ [15] and MPLS [16]. 3GPP has also recently 
introduced a new domain called IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) 
for UMTS. The main objective of IMS is to deliver innovative

and cost-effective services such as IP telephony, media streaming 
and multiparty gaming by providing IP connectivity to every 
mobile device [24].  
In the light of this, researchers have recently focused on 
understanding the nature of wireless IP traffic and early studies 
have shown that wireless data traffic also exhibits self-similarity 
and long-range dependency [25-28]. Much of the current 
understanding of wireless IP traffic modeling is based on the 
simplistic Poisson model, which can yield misleading results and 
hence poor wireless network planning. Since the properties and 
behavior of self-similar traffic is very different from traditional 
Poisson or Markovian traffic, several issues need to be addressed 
in modeling wireless IP traffic to provide end-to-end QoS to a 
variety of heterogeneous applications. We begin by giving an 
overview of related work on wired and wireless IP traffic 
modeling along with a comparison of our model with previous 
work.
RELATED WORK
In this section, we first discuss the related work which has been 
done in the area of performance evaluation of wired IP and 
Wireless IP networks under self-similar input and then we 
compare our model with the previous ones.
2.1

Previous Work on IP Traffic Modeling
There has been much work done on Internet traffic modeling based 
on queueing theory in the presence of self-similar traffic [29-34]. 
In [33], a Matrix Geometric (analytical) method is used to compute 
numerical results for a two class DiffServ link being fed by a 
Markovian Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) input. A 
weakness of this model is that MMPP may require an estimation of 
a large number of parameters. An OPNET based simulation 
approach was adopted in [34] to see the impact of self-similarity
on the performance evaluation of DiffServ networks. As a result, 
an idea of expected queue length was given in relation to the Hurst 
parameter and server utilization. It is difficult to offer guaranteed 
QoS parameters on the basis of such analysis. The major weakness 
of the majority of available queueing based results is that only the 
FIFO queueing discipline has been considered for serving the 
incoming traffic and thus differential treatment to different kinds 
of traffic can not be provided. In addition, the previous results are 
asymptotic. We also refer the readers to [35-39] for an overview of 
previous work that has been carried out to evaluate the 
performance of IP networks. The major drawback of the existing 
work is that, the queueing models considered are not able to 
capture the self-similar characteristics of Internet traffic. 
Furthermore, it is important to note that most of the previous work 
is focused on the analysis of one type of traffic only without 
discussing its affect on the performance of other kinds of network 
traffic.
2.2

Previous Work on Wireless IP Traffic
Modeling
Few studies have focused on wireless traffic modeling and here we 
discuss the most relevant work. As shown in Fig. 1, the principle 
of allocation of data flows between end users and GGSN leads to 
increasing load on the network elements when moving closer to 
the GGSN. Hence, GGSN is the node most exposed to self-similar 
influence in UMTS [40]. The influence of self-similar input on 
GGSN performance in the UMTS Release 5 IM-subsystem has 
been analyzed on the basis of a FBM/D/1/W queueing system 
(FBM-Fractional Brownian Motion) in [40]. In this work, different 
probabilistic parameters of GGSN such as average queue length 
and average service rate were also found. The work in [41] 
presents modeling and a simulation study of the Telus Mobility (a 
commercial service provider) Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) 
network. The collected results on average queueing delay and 
buffer overflow probability indicated that genuine traffic traces
181
produce longer queues as compared to traditional Poisson based 
traffic models. To get an overview of the analysis done in wireless 
IP traffic modeling with self-similar input, we refer the readers to 
[42-45]. These studies are merely based on characterization of 
wireless traffic. To provide differential treatment to multiple 
traffic classes with different QoS demands, there is a need to 
accurately determine end-to-end QoS parameters such as delay, 
jitter, throughput, packet loss, availability and per-flow sequence 
preservation.
2.3

Comparison of our Model with Prior
Work
To overcome the limitations of the previous work in traffic 
modeling (wired and wireless IP traffic), we present a realistic and 
novel analytical model by considering four different classes of 
traffic that exhibit long-range dependence and self-similarity. Our 
model implements four queues based on a G/M/1 queueing system 
and we analyze it on the basis of priority with no preemption. The 
traffic model considered is parsimonious with few parameters and 
has been studied in [46]. The model is furthermore similar to 
on/off processes, in particular to its variation N-Burst model 
studied in [47] where packets are incorporated. However, only a 
single type of traffic is considered in [47]. We present a novel 
analytical approach and make the following contributions to 
Wireless IP traffic modeling. 
Interarrival Time Calculations: We calculate the packet 
interarrival time distributions for the particular self-similar traffic 
model [46] for the first time in this paper. The distribution of cross 
interarrival time between different types of packets is derived on 
the basis of single packet results. 
Packet Delays for Multiple Self-Similar Traffic Classes: We 
consider a G/M/1 queueing system which takes into account four 
different classes of self-similar input traffic denoted by SS/M/1 
and analyze it on the basis of non preemptive priority and find 
exact packet delays. To date, no closed form expressions have 
been presented for G/M/1 with priority. 
Embedded Markov Chain Formulation: We also formulate the 
embedded Markov chain of G/M/1 by considering all possible 
states and derive the corresponding transition probabilities. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 3 and 4 are 
devoted to explaining the self-similar traffic model with multiple 
classes and the calculation of interarrival times respectively. 
Section 5 explains the procedure of formulating the embedded 
Markov Chain along with the derivation of packet delays. The 
applications of the model are discussed in section 6. Finally, 
conclusion and future work is given in Section 7.

TRAFFIC MODEL
The traffic model considered here [46] belongs to a particular class 
of self-similar traffic models also called telecom process in [48], 
recently. The model captures the dynamics of packet generation 
while accounting for the scaling properties of the traffic in 
telecommunication networks. Such models, also called infinite 
source models, are similar to on/off processes with heavy tailed on 
and/or off times. What is more, our model abstracts the packet 
arrival process in particular and facilitates queueing analysis by 
the approaches developed in the sequel.
In the framework of a Poisson point process, the model represents 
an infinite number of potential sources. The traffic is found by 
aggregating the number of packets generated by such sources. 
Each source initiates a session with a heavy-tailed distribution, in 
particular a Pareto distribution whose density is given by

corresponds to the sum of packets generated by all sessions 
initiated in [0,t] until the session expires if that happens before t, 
and until t if is does not. The stationary version of this model 
based on an infinite past is considered in calculations below. The 
packet sizes are assumed to be fixed because each queue 
corresponds to a certain type of application where the packets have 
fixed size or at least fixed service time distribution.

The traffic model Y is long-range dependent and almost second-order
self-similar; the auto covariance function of its increments is 
that of fractional Gaussian noise. Three different heavy traffic 
limits are possible depending on the rate of increase in the traffic 
parameters [46, 48]. Two of these limits are well known self-similar
processes, fractional Brownian motion and Levy process, 
which do not account for packet dynamics in particular.
INTERARRIVAL TIMES
Packet interarrival time distributions for the particular self-similar 
traffic model are calculated for the first time in this paper. We 
consider a single type of packet first. The distributions of cross 
interarrival time between different types of packets are derived on 
the basis of single packet results.
4.1

Interarrival Times for a Single Class
Although the packet arrival process itself is long-range dependent 
and shows self-similarity, the number of alive sessions at a period 
of time, say of length t, has a stationary distribution and is 
Poisson distributed. The alive sessions at any time can be further 
split into independent components as those session that last longer 
than t and those that expire before t. Such results are well known 
[49, pg.273] and will be used to derive the interarrival time 
distribution of the packets.  
Given that there is a packet arrival at an instant in time, we aim to 
find the distribution of the time until next arrival denoted by T.
We will find

. When the event
is considered, the information that there is a packet
arrival is equivalent to the information that there is at least one 
session alive at the given instant. This follows from the 
assumption that local packet generation process is Poisson over 
each session. The probability that next interarrival is greater than t

memoryless property of exponential distribution. That is,

in other words the utilization of an
system. The
event that next packet interarrival is greater than t can be split as 
follows:

The active sessions that expire before t do not incur 
any new arrivals.
·

The active sessions that expire after t do not incur any 
new arrivals
·

No new session arrivals in t or at least one session 
arrival with no packet arrival in t.
We find the probability that all three events occur at the same 
time by using the independence of a Poisson point process over 
disjoint sets. The result is

QUEUEING MODEL
We consider a model of four queues based on G/M/1 by 
considering four different classes of self-similar input traffic 
denoted by SS/M/1, and analyze it on the basis of priority with no 
preemption. Let the service time distribution have rate

The usual embedded Markov chain [51] formulation of
is based on the observation of the queueing system at
the time of arrival instants, right before an arrival. At such 
instants, the number in the system is the number of packets that 
arriving packet sees in the queue plus packets in service, if any, 
excluding the arriving packet itself. We specify the states and the 
transition probability matrix P of the Markov chain with the self-similar
model for four types of traffic.

This is the case where a transition occurs from an arrival of type 1 
to an arrival of type 2 such that the first arrival has seen a type 1 
packet in service,   packets of type 1 (equivalently, total of
queue 1 and the packet in service) and
packets of type 2 (in
this case only queue 2),  packets of type 3 and
packets of
type 4 in the system. The transition occurs to
packets of type
1,
packets of type 2, with a type 2 packet in service,

packets of type 3 and
packets of type 4 in the system. Due to
priority scheduling, an arrival of type 2 can see a type 2 packet in 
service in the next state only if all type 1 packets including the 
one that arrived in the previous state are exhausted during the

5.3 Limiting Distribution and Waiting Times
Steady state distribution

as seen by an arrival can be found by
solving


=
P
using the transition matrix
P
of the Markov
chain analyzed above. In practice, the queue capacity is limited in 
a router. So, the steady state distribution exists.  
To the best of our knowledge, no previous analytical expressions 
are available for the waiting time of a G/M/1 queue with priority. 
Our analysis relies on the limiting distribution of the state of the 
queue at the arrival instances, which can be computed using the 
analysis given above for our self-similar traffic model. In general, 
the following analysis is valid for any G/M/1 queueing system 
where the limiting distribution

at the arrival instances can be
computed. The expected waiting time for the highest priority 
queue can be  found as

are the respective capacities of each
queue. This follows clearly from the fact that an arriving packet 
of higher priority will wait until all packets of the same priority as 
well as the packet in service are served. Depending on the type of 
the packet in service, we have the constituent expressions in the 
sum.

On the other hand, we obtain the expected waiting time for the 
low priority queues by analyzing the events that constitute this 
delay. The amount of work in the system at any time is defined as 
the (random) sum of all service times that will be required by the 
packets in the system at that instant. The waiting time of a type 2 
packet (which is 2

highest priority queue) can be written as

packets arriving during Z

particular to the arrival process. That is, expectation of the

called the arrival rate, given by the product of the arrival rate of

APPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL
Here we give an overview of the prime application of the model. 
3G systems such as UMTS and CDMA2000 are leaning towards 
an all-IP network architecture for transporting IP multimedia 
services [52]. An all-IP DiffServ platform is the currently most 
promising architecture to interwork the heterogeneous wireless 
access networks and the Internet to provide broadband access, 
seamless global roaming and QoS guarantees for various IP 
multimedia services [53]. To transport UMTS services through IP 
networks without loosing end-to-end QoS provisioning, a 
consistent and efficient QoS mapping between UMTS services and 
IP QoS classes is required. According to 3GPP, UMTS-to-IP QoS 
mapping is performed by a translation function in the GGSN 
router that classifies each UMTS packet flow and maps it to a 
suitable IP QoS class [52]. In order to make accurate mappings and 
to ensure guaranteed QoS parameters to the end user of mobile 
Internet, it is essential to being able to accurately model the end-to
-end behavior of different classes of wireless IP traffic 
(conversational, interactive, streaming and background) passing 
through a DiffServ domain. Several queueing tools have been 
developed that can be implemented in IP routers within different
QoS domains including Priority Queueing (PQ), Custom Queueing 
(CQ), Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ), Class Based Weighted Fair 
Queueing (CBWFQ) and Low-Latency Queueing (LLQ) [54]. 
Our model is directly applicable to the problem of determining the 
end-to-end queueing behavior of IP traffic through both Wired and 
wireless IP domains, but modeling accuracy is more crucial in 
resource constrained environments such as wireless networks. For 
example, our model is directly able to analyze the behavior of four 
different QoS classes of UMTS traffic passing through a DiffServ 
domain, in which routers are implemented with priority queueing. 
Thus, the model enables tighter bounds on actual behavior so that 
over-provisioning can be minimized. It also enables translations of 
traffic behavior between different kinds of QoS domains so that it 
is possible to map reservations made in different domains to 
provide session continuity.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have presented a novel analytical model based on 
G/M/1 queueing system for accurate modeling of wireless IP 
traffic behavior under the assumption of four different classes of 
self-similar traffic. We have analyzed it on the basis of non-preemptive
priority and explicit expressions of expected waiting 
time for the corresponding classes have been derived. The model 
represents an important step towards the overall aim of finding 
realistic (under self-similar traffic assumptions) end-to-end QoS 
behavior (in terms of QoS parameters such as delay, jitter and 
throughput) of multiple traffic classes passing through 
heterogeneous wireless IP domains (IntServ, DiffServ and MPLS). 
At the moment, we are working on the numerical analysis to find 
solutions to the suggested imbedded Markov Chain in order to find 
exact QoS parameter bounds for a given system. Our future work 
will focus to analyze the performance of different QoS domains 
implemented with different queueing disciplines.
