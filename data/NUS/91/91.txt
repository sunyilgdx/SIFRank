Fast String Sorting Using Order-Preserving
Compression
ABSTRACT
We give experimental evidence for the benefits of order-preserving compression in sorting algorithms
. While, in general, any algorithm might benefit from compressed data because of reduced
paging requirements, we identified two natural candidates that would further benefit from order-preserving
compression, namely string-oriented sorting algorithms and word-RAM algorithms for
keys of bounded length. The word-RAM model has some of the fastest known sorting algorithms
in practice. These algorithms are designed for keys of bounded length, usually 32 or 64 bits, which
limits their direct applicability for strings. One possibility is to use an order-preserving compression
scheme, so that a bounded-key-length algorithm can be applied. For the case of standard
algorithms, we took what is considered to be the among the fastest nonword RAM string sorting
algorithms, Fast MKQSort, and measured its performance on compressed data. The Fast MKQSort
algorithm of Bentley and Sedgewick is optimized to handle text strings. Our experiments show
that order-compression techniques results in savings of approximately 15% over the same algorithm
on noncompressed data. For the word-RAM, we modified Andersson's sorting algorithm to
handle variable-length keys. The resulting algorithm is faster than the standard Unix sort by a
factor of 1.5X . Last, we used an order-preserving scheme that is within a constant additive term
of the optimal Hu­Tucker, but requires linear time rather than O(m log m), where m
= | | is the
size of the alphabet.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the size of corporate data collections has grown rapidly. For
example, in the mid-1980s, a large text collection was in the order of 500 MB.
Today, large text collections are over a thousand times larger. At the same
time, archival legacy data that used to sit in tape vaults is now held on-line in
large data warehouses and regularly accessed. Data-storage companies, such
as EMC, have emerged to serve this need for data storage, with market capitalizations
that presently rival that of all but the largest PC manufacturers.
Devising algorithms for these massive data collections requires novel techniques
. Because of this, over the last 10 years there has been renewed interest
in research on indexing techniques, string-matching algorithms, and very large
database-management systems among others.
Consider, for example, a corporate setting, such as a bank, with a large collection
of archival data, say, a copy of every bank transaction ever made. Data
is stored in a data-warehouse facility and periodically accessed, albeit perhaps
somewhat unfrequently. Storing the data requires a representation that is succinct
, amenable to arbitrary searches, and supports efficient random access.
Aside from savings in storage, a no less important advantage of a succinct
representation of archival data is a resulting improvement in performance of
sorting and searching operations. This improvement is twofold: First, in general
, almost any sorting and searching algorithm benefits from operating on
smaller keys, as this leads to a reduced number of page faults as observed by
Moura et al. [1997]. Second, benefits can be derived from using a word-RAM
(unit-cost RAM) sorting algorithm, such as that of [Andersson 1994; Andersson
and Nilsson 1998]. This algorithm sorts n w-bits keys on a unit-cost RAM with
word size w in time O(n log n). As one can expect, in general, this algorithm
cannot be applied to strings as the key length is substantially larger than the
word size. However, if all or most of the keys can be compressed to below the
word size, then this algorithm can be applied--with ensuing gains in performance
.
There are many well-known techniques for compressing data, however, most
of them are not order preserving and do not support random access to the data
as the decoding process is inherently sequential [Bell et al. 1990; Knuth 1997].
Hence, it is important that the compression technique be static as well as order
preserving. This rules out many of the most powerful compression techniques,
such as those based on the Ziv­Lempel method [Ziv and Lempel 1978], which
are more attuned to compression of long text passages in any event (we note,
however, that it is possible to implement certain search operations on Lempel­
Ziv encoded text as shown by Farach and Thorup [1998], and K ¨arkk ¨ainen and
Ukknonen [1996]). The need to preserve order also eliminates many dictionary
techniques, such as Huffman codes [Knuth 1997; Antoshenkov 1997].

Fast String Sorting Using Order-Preserving Compression

Hence, we consider a special type of static code, namely, order-preserving
compression schemes, which are similar to Huffman codes. More precisely, we
are given an alphabet
with an associated frequency p
i
for each symbol s
i
.
The compression scheme E :
{0, 1}

maps each symbol into an element
of a set of prefix-free strings over
{0, 1}

. The goal is to minimize the entropy
s
i

p
i
|E(s
i
)
| with the added condition that if s
i
&lt; s
j
then E(s
i
)
&lt; E(s
j
) in the
lexicographic ordering of
{0, 1}

. This is in contrast to Huffman codes, which,
in general, do not preserve the order of the initial alphabet. Such a scheme is
known as order preserving.
Optimal order-preserving compression schemes were introduced by Gilbert
and Moore [1959] who gave an O(n
3
) algorithm for computing the optimal code.
This was later improved by Hu and Tucker, who gave a
(n log n) algorithm,
which is optimal [Hu 1973]. In this paper we use a linear time-encoding
algorithm that approximates the optimal order-preserving compression scheme
to within a constant additive term to produce a compressed form of the data.
The savings are of significance when dealing with large alphabets, which arise
in applications, such as DNA databases and compression, on words. We test
the actual quality of the compression scheme on real string data and obtain
that the compressed image produced by the linear algorithm is within 0.4,
and 5.2% of the optimal, in the worst case. The experiments suggest that
the compression ratio is, in practice, much better than what is predicted by
theory.
Then, using the compressed form, we test the performance of the sorting
algorithm against the standard Unix sort in the Sun Solaris OS. Using data
from a 1-GB world wide web crawl, we study first the feasability of compressing
the keys to obtain 64-bit word-length keys. In this case we obtain that only 2%
of the keys cannot be resolved within the first 64 significant bits. This small
number of keys are flagged and resolved in a secondary stage. For this modified
version of Andersson's, we report a factor of 1.5X improvement over the timings
reported by Unix sort.
As noted above, an important advantage of order-preserving compression
schemes is that they support random access. As such we consider as a likely
application scenario that the data is stored in compressed format. As an example
, consider a database-management system (DBMS). Such systems often use
sorting as an intermediate step in the process of computing a
join statement.
The DBMS would benefit from an order-preserving compression scheme, first,
by allowing faster initial loading (copying) of the data into memory and, second,
by executing a sorting algorithm tuned for compressed data, which reduces both
processing time and the amount of paging required by the algorithm itself if
the data does not fit in main memory. The contribution of each of these aspects
is highlighted later in Tables V and VI.
The paper is laid out as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the linear time
algorithm for encoding and observe that its approximation term follows from
a theorem of Bayer [1975]. In Section 3, we compare the compression ratio
empirically for string data using the Calgary corpus. In Section 4, we compare
the performance of sorting algorithms aided by order-preserving data
compression.

ORDER-PRESERVING COMPRESSION
We consider the problem of determining code-words (encoded forms) such that
the compression ratio is as high as possible. Code-words may or may not have
the prefix property. In the prefix property case, the problem reduces to finding
an optimum alphabetic binary tree.
2.1 Problem Definition
Formally, the problem of finding optimal alphabetic binary trees can be stated
as follows: Given a sequence of n positive weights w
1
, w
2
,
· · · , w
n
, find a binary
tree in which all weights appear in the leaves such that
r The weights on the leaves occur in order when traversing the tree from left
to right. Such a tree is called an alphabetic tree.
r The sum
1
in
w
i
l
i
is minimized, where l
i
is the depth (distance from root)
of the ith leave from left. If so, this is an optimal alphabetic tree.
If we drop the first condition, the problem becomes the well-known problem of
building Huffman trees, which is known to have the same complexity as sorting.
2.2 Previous Work
Mumey introduced the idea of finding optimal alphabetic binary tree in linear
time for some special classes of inputs in Mumey [1992]. One example is a simple
case solvable in O(n) time when the values of the weights in the initial sequence
are all within a term of two. Mumey showed that the region-based method,
described in Mumey [1992], exhibits linear time performance for a significant
variety of inputs. Linear time solutions were discovered for the following special
cases: when the input sequence of nodes is sorted sequence, bitonic sequence,
weights exponentially separated, and weights within a constant factor [see
Larmore and Przytycka 1998].
Moura et al. [1997] considered the benefits of constructing a suffix tree
over compressed text using an order-preserving code. In their paper, they observe
dramatic savings in the construction of a suffix tree over the compressed
text.
2.3 A Simple Linear-Approximation Algorithm
Here, we present an algorithm that creates a compression dictionary in linear
time on the size of the alphabet and whose compression ratio compares very
favorably to that of optimal algorithms which have
(n log n) running time,
where n is the number of symbols or tokens for the compression scheme. For the
purposes of presentation, we refer to the symbols or tokens as characters in an
alphabet
. In practice these "characters" might well correspond to, for example,
entire English words or commonly occurring three-or four-letter combinations.
In this case, the "alphabet" can have tens of thousands of tokens, and, hence,
the importance of linear-time algorithms for creating the compression scheme.
The idea of the proposed algorithm is to divide the set of weights into two
almost equal size subsets and solve the problem recursively for them. As we

show in Section 2.4, this algorithm finds a compression scheme within an additive
term of 2 bits of the average code length found by Huffman or Hu­Tucker
algorithms.
2.4 Algorithm
Let w
1
, w
2
,
. . . , w
n
be the weights of the alphabet characters or word codes to
be compressed in alphabetical order. The procedure Make(i, j ) described below,
finds a tree in which tokens with weights w
i
, w
i
+1
,
. . . , w
j
are in the leaves:
Procedure Make(i, j )
1. if (i == j ) return a tree with one node containing w
i
.
2. Find k such that (w
i
+ w
i
+1
+ · · · + w
k
)
- (w
k
+1
+ · · · + w
j
) is minimum.
3. Let T
1
= Make(i, k) and T
2
= Make(k
+ 1, j )
4. Return tree T with left subtree T
1
and right subtree T
2
.
In the next two subsections we study (a) the time complexity of the proposed
algorithm and (b) bounds on the quality of the approximation obtained.
2.5 Time Complexity
First observe that, aside from line 2, all other operations take constant time.
Hence, so long as line 2 of the algorithm can be performed in logarithmic time,
then the running time T (n) of the algorithm would be given by the recursion
T (n)
= T(k)+T(n-k)+ O(log k), and, thus, T(n) = O(n). Therefore, the critical
part of the algorithm is line 2: how to divide the set of weights into two subsets
of almost the same size in logarithmic time.
Suppose that for every k, the value of a
k
= b
i
+ w
i
+ w
i
+1
+ · · · + w
k
is given
for all k
i, where b
i
is a given integer to be specified later. Notice that the
a
j
's form an increasing sequence as a
i
&lt; a
i
+1
&lt; · · · &lt; a
j
. Now the expression
in line 2 of the algorithm can be rewritten as follows:
|(w
i
+ w
i
+1
+ · · · + w
k
)
- (w
k
+1
+ · · · + w
j
)
| = |a
j
- 2a
k
+ b
i
|
Thus, given the value of a
k
, for all k, one can easily find the index u for which
|a
j
-2a
u
+b
i
| is minimum using a variation of a one-sided binary search, known
as galloping. Define a
k
:
=
k
i
=1
w
k
and, hence, b
i
= a
i
-1
=
i

w and modify
the algorithm as follows:
Procedure Make(i, j , b)
1. If (i == j ) return a tree with one node containing w
i
.
2. Let k
= Minimize(i, j , b, 1).
3. Let T
1
= Make(i, k, b) and T
2
= Make(k + 1, j , a
k
)
4. Return tree T with left subtree T
1
and right subtree T
2
.
where the Minimize procedure is a one-sided binary search for the element
closest to zero in the sequence
{a

- 2a
k
- 2b}

. More precisely:

Procedure Minimize(i, j , b, g )
1. if ( j
- i  1) return min{|a
j
- 2a
i
- 2p|, |a
j
+ 2b|}.
2. let
= i + g, u = j - g.
3. if (a
j
- 2a - 2b) &gt; 0 and (a
j
- 2a
u
- 2b) &lt; 0 then return Minimize(i, j ,b,2g).
4. if (a
j
- 2a - 2b) &lt; 0 then return Minimize( - g/2, ,b,1).
5. if (a
j
- 2a
u
- 2b) &gt; 0 then return Minimize(u,u + g/2,b,1).
The total time taken by all calls to Minimize is given by the recursion T (n)
=
T (k)
+ T(n - k) + log k, if k  n/2 and T(n) = T(k) + T(n - k) + log(n - k)
otherwise, where n is the number of elements in the entire range and k is
the position of the element found in the first call to Make. This recursion has
solution T (n)
2n - log n - 1, as can easily be verified:
T (n)
= T(k) + T(n - k) + log k  2n - 1 - log(n - k) - 1  2n - 1 - log n
when k
n/2. The case k &gt; n/2 is analogous.
To compute total time, we have that, at initialization time, the algorithm
calculates a
k
for all k and then makes a call to Make(1, n, 0). The total cost of
line 2 is linear and, hence, the entire algorithm takes time O(n).
2.6 Approximation Bounds
Recall that a binary tree T can be interpreted as representing a coding for symbols
corresponding to its leaves by assigning 0/1 labels to left/right branches,
respectively. Given a tree T and a set of weights associated to its leaves, we
denote as E(T ), the expected number of bits needed to represent each of these
symbols using codes represented by the tree. More precisely, if T has n leaves
with weights w

This fact can be proved directly by careful study of the partition mechanism

A weight-balanced tree is an alphabetic binary search tree
constructed recursively from the root by minimizing the difference between the
weights of the left and right subtrees.
That is, a weight-balanced tree minimizes

as required.
This shows that in theory the algorithm proposed is fast and has only a small
performance penalty in terms of compression over both the optimal encoding
method and the information theoretical lower bound given by the entropy.
EXPERIMENTS ON COMPRESSION RATIO
In this section we experimentally compare the performance of the algorithm in
terms of compression against other static-compression codes. We compare three
algorithms: Huffman, Hu­Tucker, and our algorithm on a number of random
frequency distributions. We compared alphabets of size n, for variable n. In
the case of English, this corresponds to compression on words, rather than on
single characters. Each character was given a random weight between 0 and
100, 000, which is later normalized. The worst-case behavior of our algorithm
in comparison with Hu­Tucker and Huffman algorithms is shown in Table I.
For each sample, we calculated the expected number of bits required by each
algorithm on that frequency distribution and reported the ratio least favorable
among those reported.
We also compared the performance of the proposed linear-time algorithm
with Huffman and Hu­Tucker compression using the Calgary corpus, a common
benchmark in the field of data compression. This is shown in Table II.
We report both the compression ratio of each of the solutions as well as the

comparative performance of the linear-time solution with the other two well-known
static methods. As we can see, the penalty on the compression factor
of the linear-time algorithm over Huffman, which is not order-preserving, or
Hu­Tucker, which takes time O(n log n), is minimal.
It is important to observe that for the data set tested, the difference between
the optimal Hu­Tucker and the linear compression code was, in all cases, below
0.2 bits, which is much less than the worst-case additive term of 2 predicted by
Bayer's theorem.
STRING SORTING USING A WORD-RAM ALGORITHM
In this section, we compare the performance of sorting on the compressed text
against the uncompressed form [as in Moura et al. 1997], including Bentley
and Sedgewicks's FastSort [Bentley and Sedgewick 1997], as well as Andersson's
word-RAM sort [Andersson 1994]. Traditionally, word-RAM algorithms
operate on unbounded length keys, such as strings, by using radix/bucket-sort
variants which iteratively examine the keys [Andersson and Nilsson 1994]. In
contrast, our method uses order-preserving compression to first reduce the size
of the keys, then sort by using fixed-key size word-RAM algorithms [Andersson
et al. 1995], sorting keys into buckets. We observed experimentally that this
suffices to sort the vast majority of the strings when sorting 100 MB files of

web-crawled text data. In this case, each of the buckets contained very few elements
, in practice. We also tested the algorithms on the Calgary corpus, which
is a standard benchmark in the field of text compression.
We consider the use of a word-RAM sorting algorithm to create a dictionary
of the words appearing in a given text. The standard word-RAM algorithms
have as a requirement that the keys fit within the word size of the RAM machine
being used. Modern computers have word sizes of 32 or 64 bits. In this
particular example, we tested Andersson's 32 bit implementation [Andersson
and Nilsson 1998] of the O(n log log n) algorithm by Andersson et al. [1995]. We
also tested the performance of Bentley and Sedgewick's [1997] MKQSort running
on compressed data using order-preserving compression. The algorithm is
a straightforward implementation of the code in Bentley and Sedgewick [1997].
Observe that one can use a word-RAM algorithm on keys longer than w bits
by initially sorting on the first w bits of the key and then identifying "buckets"
where two or more strings are "tied," i.e., share the first w bits. The algorithm
proceeds recursively on each of these buckets until there are no further ties.
This method is particularly effective if the number of ties is not too large.
To study this effect, we consider two word dictionaries and a text source. One
is collected from a 1-GB crawl of the world wide web, the second from all the
unique words appearing in the Calgary corpus; the last one is a more recent
3.3-GB crawl of the world wide web. This is motivated by an indexing application
for which sorting a large number of words was required. In principle, the
result is equally applicable to other settings, such as sorting of alphanumeric
fields in a database.
In the case of the web crawl we considered two alternative tokenization
schemes. The first one tokenizes on alphanumeric characters while the second
ignores numbers in favor of words only. Table III shows the number of buckets
that have more than one element after the first pass in the uncompressed
and the compressed form of the text. We report both the figure for the proposed
linear algorithm and for the optimal Hu­Tucker scheme. Observe the
dramatic reduction in the number of buckets that require further processing in
the compressed data.
In fact the numbers of ties in the compressed case is sufficiently small that
aborting the recursion after the first pass and using a simpler sorting algorithm
on the buckets is a realistic alternative. In comparison, in the uncompressed
case the recursion reaches depth three in the worst case before other types of
sorting become a realistic possibility.
In the case of the Calgary corpus, the number of buckets with ties in the
uncompressed form of the text ranged from 3 to 8%. After compressing the text,
the number of ties, in all cases, rounded to 0
.0%. The specific figures for a subset
of the Calgary corpus are shown in Table IV.

Notice that in all cases the performance of the optimal Hu­Tucker algorithm
and the linear algorithm is comparable. We should also emphasize that while
the tests in this paper used compression on alphanumeric characters only, the
compression scheme can be applied to entire words [see, for example, Mumey
1992]. In this case, the size of the code dictionary can range in the thousands
of symbols, which makes the savings of a linear-time algorithm particularly
relevant.
Last, we considered a series of ten web crawls from Google, each of approximately
100 MB in size (3.3 GB in total). In this case, we operate under the
assumption that the data is stored in the suitable format to the corresponding
algorithm. We posit that it is desirable to store data in compressed format, as
this results also in storage savings while not sacrificing searchability because of
the order-preserving nature of the compression. We tokenized and sorted each of
these files to create a dictionary, a common preprocessing step for some indexing
algorithms. The tokenization was performed on nonalphanumeric characters.
For this test, we removed tokens larger than 32 bits from the tokenized file. In
practice, these tokens would be sorted using a second pass, as explained earlier.
We first studied the benefits of order-preserving compression alone by comparing
the time taken to sort the uncompressed and compressed forms of the text.
The tokens were sorted using the Unix
sort routine, Unix qsort, Fast MKQSort,
and Andersson's sort algorithm [Andersson and Nilsson 1998]. Table V shows a
comparison of CPU times among the different sorting algorithms, while Table
VI shows the comparison in performance including I/O time for copying the
data into memory. Note that there are observed gains both in CPU time alone
and in CPU plus I/O timings as a result of using the data-compressed form.
We report timings in individual form for the first three crawls as well as
the average sorting time across all 10 files together with the variance. On the
data provided, Fast MKQSort is the best possible choice with the compressed
variant, being 20% faster than the uncompressed form. These are substantial
savings for such a highly optimized algorithm.
While, in this case, we focused on key lengths below w bits, the savings from
compression can be realized by most other sorting, searching, or indexing mechanisms
, both by the reduction of the key length field and by the reduced demands
in terms of space. To emphasize, there are two aspects of order-preserving

compression, which have a positive impact on performance. The first is that
when comparing two keys byte-per-byte, we are now, in fact, comparing more
than key at once, since compressed characters fit at a rate of more than 1 per
byte. Second, the orginal data size is reduced. This leads to a decrease in the
amount of paging to external memory, which is often the principal bottleneck
for algorithms on large data collections.
CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we studied the benefits of order-preserving compression for
sorting strings in the word-RAM model. First, we propose a simple linear-approximation
algorithm for optimal order-preserving compression, which acts
reasonably well in comparison with optimum algorithms, both in theory and
in practice. The approximation is within a constant additive term of both the
optimum scheme and the information theoretical ideal, i.e., the entropy of the
probabilistic distribution associated to the character frequency. We then test
the benefits of this algorithm using the sorting algorithm of Andersson for the
word-RAM, as well as Bentley and Sedgewick's fast MKQSort. We present experimental
data based on a 1-GB web crawl, showing that Fast MKQSort and
Andersson are more efficient for compressed data.
