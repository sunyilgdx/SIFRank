Lower Bounds & Competitive Algorithms for Online Scheduling of Unit-Size Tasks to Related Machines
ABSTRACT
In this paper we study the problem of assigning unit-size
tasks to related machines when only limited online information
is provided to each task. This is a general framework
whose special cases are the classical multiple-choice games
for the assignment of unit-size tasks to identical machines.
The latter case was the subject of intensive research for the
last decade. The problem is intriguing in the sense that the
natural extensions of the greedy oblivious schedulers, which
are known to achieve near-optimal performance in the case
of identical machines, are proved to perform quite poorly in
the case of the related machines.
In this work we present a rather surprising lower bound
stating that any oblivious scheduler that assigns an arbitrary
number of tasks to n related machines would need
log
n
loglog
n
polls of machine loads per task, in order to
achieve a constant competitive ratio versus the optimum
offline assignment of the same input sequence to these machines
. On the other hand, we prove that the missing information
for an oblivious scheduler to perform almost optimally
, is the amount of tasks to be inserted into the system.
In particular, we provide an oblivious scheduler that only
uses
O(loglog n) polls, along with the additional information
of the size of the input sequence, in order to achieve
a constant competitive ratio vs.
the optimum offline assignment
. The philosophy of this scheduler is based on an
interesting exploitation of the slowfit concept ([1, 5, 3];
for a survey see [6, 9, 16]) for the assignment of the tasks
to the related machines despite the restrictions on the provided
online information, in combination with a layered in-This

this oblivious scheduler as the core of an adaptive scheduler
that does not demand the knowledge of the input sequence
and yet achieves almost the same performance.
INTRODUCTION
The problem of the Online Assignment of Tasks to Related
Machines is defined as follows: there are
n machines
possibly of different speeds, that are determined by a speed
vector c
(C
1
, . . . , C
n
)
IR
n
+
, and an input sequence
of m independent tasks to be assigned to these machines.
The tasks arrive sequentially, along with their associated
weights (positive reals) and have to be assigned immediately
and uniquely to the machines of the system. The size
of the input sequence as well as the weights of the tasks
are determined by an oblivious adversary (denoted here by
ADV). Each task has to be assigned upon its arrival to one
of the machines, using the following information:
· (possibly a portion of) the online information of current
status of the system,
· the offline information of the machine speeds, and
· its own weight.
The tasks are considered to be of infinite duration (permanent
tasks) and no preemption is allowed. The cost of
an online scheduler
ALG for the assignment of an input sequence
of tasks  (denoted by ALG()) is the maximum load
eventually appearing in the system. In case that a random-ized
scheduler is taken into account, then the cost of the
scheduler is the expectation of the corresponding random
variable. The quality of an online scheduler is compared vs.
the optimum offline assignment of the same input sequence
to the n machines. We denote the optimum offline cost for
 by ADV(). That is, we consider the competitive ratio
(or performance guarantee) to be the quality measure, (eg,
see [6]):
Definition
1.1. An online scheduler
ALG is said to achieve
a competitive ratio of parameters (a, ), if for any
124
input sequence  the relation connecting its own cost ALG()
and the optimum offline cost of
ADV, are related by
ALG()  a · ADV() + .
ALG is strictly a-competitive if
, ALG()  a · ADV().
In this work we study the consequences of providing only
some portion of the online information to a scheduler. That
is, we focus our interest on the case where each task is capable
of checking the online status only by a (small wrt n)
number d of polls from the n machines. In this case, the
objective is to determine the trade-off between the number
of polls that are available to each of the tasks and the performance
guarantee of the online scheduler, or equivalently,
to determine the minimum number of polls per task so that
a strictly constant competitive ratio is achieved.
Additionally, we consider the case of unit-size tasks that
are assigned to related machines. Thus, each task t  [m]
has to be assigned to a machine host(t)  [n] using the following
information that is provided to it: the current loads
of d suitably chosen machines (the kind of the "suitable"
selection is one of the basic elements of a scheduler and will
be called the polling strategy from now on) and an assignment
strategy that determines the host of t among
these d selected candidates on behalf of t.
In what follows we shall consider homogeneous schedulers
, ie, schedulers that apply exactly the same protocol on
all the tasks that are inserted into the system. This choice
is justified by the fact that no task is allowed to have access
to knowledge concerning previous or forthcoming choices of
other tasks in the system, except only for the current loads
of those machines that have been chosen to be its candidate
hosts. Additionally, we shall use the terms (capacitated)
bins instead of (related) machines and (identical) balls
instead of (unit-size) tasks interchangeably, due to the profound
analogy of the problem under consideration with the
corresponding Balls & Bins problem.
1.1
Polling Strategies
The way a scheduler
ALG lets each newly inserted task
choose its d candidate hosts is called a polling strategy
(PS). We call the strategies that poll candidate machines
homogeneously for all the inserted tasks of the same size,
homogeneous polling strategies (HPS). In the present
work we consider the tasks to be indistinguishable: Each
task upon its arrival knows only the loads of the machines
that it polls, along with the speed (or equiv. capacity wrt
bins) vector c of the system.
This is why we focus our
interest in schedulers belonging to HPS. Depending on the
dependencies of the polls that are taken on behalf of a task,
we classify the polling strategies as follows:
Oblivious polling strategies(HOPS)
In this case we consider that the polling strategy on behalf
of a newly inserted task t consists of an independent (from
other tasks) choice of a d-tuple from [n]
d
according to a fixed
probability distribution f : [n]
d
[0, 1]. This probability
distribution may only depend on the common offline information
provided to each of the tasks. It should be clear
that any kind of d independent polls (with or without replacement
) on behalf of each task, falls into this family of
polling strategies. Thus the whole polling strategy is the sequence
of m d-tuples chosen independently (using the same
probability distribution f ) on behalf of the m tasks that
are to be inserted into the system. Clearly for any polling
strategy belonging to HOPS, the d random polls on behalf
of each of the m tasks could have been fixed prior to the
start of the assignments.
Adaptive polling strategies (HAPS)
In this case the i
th
poll on behalf of ball t  [m] is allowed
to exploit the information gained by the i - 1 previous polls
on behalf of the same ball. That is, unlike the case of HOPS
where the choice of d candidates of a task was oblivious to
the current system state, now the polling strategy is allowed
to direct the next poll to specific machines of the system
according to the outcome of the polls up to this point. In
this case all the polls on behalf of each task have to be taken
at runtime, upon the arrival of the task.
Remark:
It is commented that this kind of polling strategies
are not actually helpful in the case of identical machines,
where HOPS schedulers achieve asymptotically optimal performance
(see [18]). Nevertheless, we prove here that this
is not the case for the related machines. It will be shown
that oblivious strategies perform rather poorly in this setting
, while HAPS schedulers achieve actually asymptotically
optimal performance.
1.2
Assignment Strategies
Having chosen the d-size set of candidate hosts for task
t  [m], the next thing is to assign this task to one of these
machines given their current loads and possibly exploiting
the knowledge on the way that they were selected. We call
this procedure the assignment strategy. The significant
question that arises here is the following: Given the polling
strategy adopted and the knowledge that is acquired at runtime
by the polled d-tuple on behalf of a task t  [m], which
would be the optimal assignment strategy for this task so that
the eventual maximum load in the system be minimized?
In the Unit Size Tasks-Identical Machines case, when
each of the d polls is chosen iur (with replacement) from [n],
Azar et al. ([2]) show that the best assignment strategy
is the minimum load rule and requires
O(log n) polls per
task for a strictly constant competitive ratio. Consequently
V¨
ocking ([18]) has suggested the always go left strategy
, which (in combination with a properly chosen oblivious
polling strategy) only requires a total number of
O(loglog n)
in order to achieve a constant competitive ratio. In the same
work it was also shown that one should not expect much by
exploiting possible dependencies of the polls in the case of
unit-size tasks that are placed into identical machines, since
the load of the fullest machine is roughly the same as the one
achieved in the case of non-uniform but independent polls
using the always go left rule.
Nevertheless, things are quite different in the Related
Machines case: we show by our lower bound (section 3)
that even if a scheduler
ALG considers any oblivious polling
strategy and the best possible assignment strategy,
ALG
has a strict competitive ratio of at least
2d
n
4
d-2
, where d is
the number of oblivious polls per task. This implies that
in the case of the related machines there is still much space
for the adaptive polling strategies until the lower bound of
(loglog n) polls per task is matched.

Related Work
In the case of assigning unit-size tasks to identical machines
, there has been a lot of intensive research during the
last decade. If each task is capable of viewing the whole
status of the system upon its arrival (we call this the Full
Information case), then Graham's greedy algorithm assures
a competitive ratio that asymptotically tends to 2
1
n
([6]).
Nevertheless, when the tasks are granted only a limited number
of polls, things are much more complicated: In the case
of unit-size tasks and a single poll per task, the result of
Gonnet [10] has proved that for m  n the maximum load
is (1 + o(1))
ln
n
lnln
n
when the poll of each task is chosen iur
from the n machines, whp.
1
In [15] an explicit form for the
expected maximum load is given for all combinations of n
and m. From this work it easily seen that for m  n ln n, the
maximum load is
m
n
+ (
m ln n/n), which implies that by
means of competitive ratio, m  n is actually the hardest
instance.
In the case of d  2 polls per task, a bunch of new techniques
had to be applied for the analysis of such schedulers.
The main tools used in the literature for this problem have
been the layered induction, the witness tree argument and
the method of fluid models (a comprehensive presentation
of these techniques may be found in the very good survey
of Mitzenmacher et al. [14]). In the seminal paper of Azar
Broder Karlin and Upfal [2] it was proved that the proposed
scheduler abku that chooses each of the polls of a task iur
from [n] and then assigns the task to the candidate machine
of minimum load, achieves a maximum load that is at
most
m
n
+
lnln
n
ln
d
± (1). This implies a strictly O
lnln
n
ln
d
competitive
ratio, or equivalently, at least
O(ln n) polls per
task would be necessary in order to achieve a strictly constant
competitive ratio. In [18] the always go left algorithm
was proposed, which assures a maximum load of
at most
m
n
+
lnln
n
d ln 2
± (1) and thus only needs an amount
of
O(loglog n) polls per task in order to achieve a strictly
constant competitive ratio. In addition it was shown that
this is the best possible that one may hope for in the case
of assigning unit-size tasks to identical machines with only
d (either oblivious or adaptive) polls per task.
The Online Assignment of Tasks to Related Machines
problem has been thoroughly studied during the past years
for the Full Information case (eg, see chapter 12 in [6]). In
particular, it has been shown that a strictly (small) constant
competitive ratio can be achieved using the slowfit-like algorithms
that are based on the idea of exploiting the least
favourable machines (this idea first appeared in [17]). The
case of Limited Information has attracted little attention
up to this point: some recent works ([12, 13, 8]) study the
case of each task having a single poll, for its assignment
to one of the (possibly related) machines when the probability
distributions of the tasks comprise a Nash Equilibrium
. For example, in [8] it was shown that in the Related
Machines case a coordination ratio (ie, the ratio between the
worst possible expected maximum load among Nash Equilibria
over the offline optimum) of
O
log
n
logloglog
n
. However,
when all the task weights are equal then it was shown by
Mavronicolas and Spirakis [13] that the coordination ratio

is

. As for the case of d &gt; 1 in the Related
Machines problem, up to the author's knowledge this is the
first time that this problem is dealt with.
1.4
New results
In this work we show that any HOPS scheduler requires at
least
O
log
n
loglog
n
polls in order to achieve a strictly constant
competitive ratio vs. an oblivious adversary. The key point
in this lower bound argument is the construction of a system
of d+1 groups of machines running at the same speed within
each group, while the machine speeds (comparing machines
of consecutive groups) fall by a fixed factor and on the other
hand the cumulative capacities of the groups are raised by
the same factor. Then it is intuitively clear that any HOPS
scheduler cannot keep track of the current status within each
of these d + 1 groups while having only d polls per new task,
and thus it will have to pay the cost of misplacing balls in
at least one of these groups. More specifically, we show the
following lower bound:
Theorem
1.
d  1, the competitive ratio of any
d-hops scheduler is at least
2d

d-2
.
Then we propose a new d-hops scheduler OBL

which,
if it is fortified with the additional knowledge of the total
number of tasks to be inserted, then it achieves the following
upper-bound:
Theorem 2.
Let lnln n - lnlnln n &gt; d  2 and suppose
that the size of the input sequence is given as offline
information.If
OBL

provides each task with (at most) 2d
polls, then it has a strict competitive ratio that drops double-exponentially
with d.In particular the cost of OBL

It is commented that all the schedulers for the Identical
Machines-Limited Information case up to now used minimum
load
as the profound assignment rule. On the other
hand,
OBL

was inspired by the slowfit approaches for
the Related Machines-Full Information problem and the
fact that a greedy scheduler behaves badly in that case.
Up to the author's knowledge, the idea of using the slow-est
machine possible first appeared in [17]. Additionally, a
layered induction argument is employed for bounding the
amount of tasks that flow from the slower to the faster machines
in the system.
2
This then allows the use of relatively
simple arguments for bounding the maximum load
of the tasks that end up in a small fraction of the system
that consists of the fastest machines. Clearly this upper
bound is near-optimal (up to a multiplicative constant),
since it matches the  (loglog n) lower bound of the Unit
Size Tasks-Identical Machines problem ([18]) which is a
subcase of our setting.
Finally we propose a haps scheduler (
ADAPT ) that combines
the previous hops scheduler with a classical guessing

Note that this does not imply preemption of tasks which is
not allowed in our setting, but rather the event that a task
hits slower machines that are already overloaded and thus
has to assign itself to a faster machine.

A SIMPLE LOWER BOUND ON HOMOGENEOUS SINGLE-POLL GAMES
This section contains a simple argument for the claimed
lower bound on online schedulers that devote a single poll
per new task, ie, d = 1. Clearly by their nature these are
HOPS schedulers, since there is no actual option for the
assignment strategy. The proof for the lower bound of these
schedulers is rather simple but it will and shed some light to
the essence of the construction for the proof of the general
lower bound that will follow in the next section.
Let's assume that there exists a HOPS scheduler that only
uses 1 poll per task and claims to be strict a-competitive
against any oblivious adversary
ADV. Initially ADV chooses
an arbitrary real number r  n which will be fixed in the
end so as to maximize the lower bound on a. Let also the
variables C
total
, C
max
denote the total capacity and the maximum
possible polled capacity using one poll (ie, the maximum
bin capacity in this case) in the system. Consequently
ADV uses the following system of capacitated bins so that
these values are preserved:

Observe that the capacity of bin i  2 is r times smaller
than
C
max
, while on the other hand, the cumulative capacity
of the last n - 1 machines is
n-1
r
times larger than the
capacity of the largest bin in the system. Consider also the
following abbreviations of probabilities and events that may
occur upon the arrival of a new ball:

THE LOWER BOUND ON MULTI-HOPS SHCEDULERS
In this section we study the behaviour of homogeneous
schedulers that adopt an oblivious polling strategy (ie, the
polling strategy is from HOPS) and an arbitrary assignment
strategy. We call these d-hops schedulers, since the choice of
the d candidates on behalf of each ball is done independently
for each ball, according to a common probability distribution
f : [n]
d
[0, 1]. Recall that the choice of the candidate
bins for each ball is oblivious to the current system state
and thus could have been fixed prior to the beginning of the
assignments.
Theorem
1.

scheduler is at least

.
Proof:
Let f : [n]
d
[0, 1] be the adopted Oblivious
polling strategy by an arbitrary d-hops scheduler, ALG. Assume
also that
ALG uses the best possible assignment strategy
given this polling strategy, that is, each ball chooses its
own candidate bins according to f and then it may assign
itself to an arbitrarily chosen host among its candidates, depending
on the current loads of the candidate bins. Assume
also that
ALG claims a (strict) competitive ratio a against
oblivious adversaries.
As parameters of the problem we consider again the quantities
C

n
i=1
C

and
C
max
: the total capacity of a
system of n related machines and the maximum capacity
that may be returned by a single poll. We shall describe
an adversary
ADV that initially chooses an arbitrary real
number 1
r  n and then considers the system of (d + 1
groups of) n capacitated bins that is described in Table 1.
Observe that this construction preserves the following two

We fortify
ALG by allowing a perfect balance of the bins
of a group F

whenever at least one poll on behalf of a new
ball goes to a bin of this group. This is actually in order
to capture the notion of the "perfect assignment strategy
given the polling strategy" claim stated above. Clearly this
does not cause any problem since we are looking for a lower
bound. Because
ALG could lock its d choices to the first d
groups of the system, it is obvious that its competitive ratio
a is at most a

"F

d), while P

IP[E

] (call it the hitting probability
of group F

) is the probability of at least one bin from
F

being hit by a ball.
We shall charge
ALG according
to the hitting probabilities that its polling strategy determines
. Notice that these are fixed at the beginning of the
assignments since the polling strategy of
ALG is an oblivious
strategy. Furthermore, the following conditional hitting
probabilities are also determined uniquely by the polling
strategy of
ALG: i, j  [n] : i &gt; j,

of balls that may be hosted by bins of the set

without violating the assumption of a-competitiveness of
ALG, when the input sequence of tasks  is chosen by ADV.
The following lemma states an inherent property of any d-hops

constraint. All these tasks have to exploit their remaining

It is clear that

it adopts. Thus we can safely assume that there remain

DEALING WITH INPUT SEQUENCES OF KNOWN TOTAL SIZE
In this section we prove that the missing information for
an oblivious scheduler to perform efficiently is the size of
the input sequence. More specifically, considering that the
input size is provided as offline information to each of the
newly inserted tasks, we construct an oblivious scheduler
that exploits this information along with a slowfit assignment
rule and a layered induction argument for the flow of
balls from slower to faster bins, in order to achieve a strictly
constant competitive ratio with only
O(loglog n) polls per
task.
Assume that m unit-size balls are thrown into a system
of n capacitated bins with capacities C
max
=
C
n
C
n-1

· · ·  C

=
C
min
. Assume also that each ball is allowed to
poll up to 2d bins and then it has to assign itself to one of
these candidates. We additionally assume that
C
max

n
2
d+1
.
As it will become clear later by the analysis, if this was not
the case then it could only be in favour of the oblivious
scheduler that we propose, because this would allow the absorption
of the large additive constants in the performance
guarantee of the scheduler.
We consider (wlog) that the capacity vector c is nor-malized
by
n
||c||
1
so that
n
i=1
C
i
= n. We also assume
that the total size m the input sequence is given to every
newly inserted ball.
This implies that each ball can
estimate the cost
ADV(m)  opt (ie, the optimum offline
assignment of the m unit-size balls to the n capacitated
bins), and thus it can know a priori the subset of bins
that may have been used by
ADV during the whole process
.
3
Having this in mind, we can assume that every bin
in the system is legitimate, that is, it might have been
used by the optimum solution, otherwise we could have each
ball ignore all the illegitimate bins in the system. Thus,

that each of the legitimate bins of the system gets at

least one ball in the optimum offline schedule. This does not
affect the performance of
ADV, while it may only deteriorate
the performance of an online scheduler. Nevertheless, it
assures that
m
n
opt
m
n
+ 1, meaning that the fractional
load on the bins is actually a good estimation of opt.
Let the load of bin i  [n] at time t (that is, right after the
assignment of the t
th
ball of the input sequence) be denoted
as
t
(i)
q
t
(
i)
C
i
, where q
t
(i) is the number of balls assigned
to bin i up to that time. The following definition refers to
the notion of saturated bins in the system, ie, overloaded
bins wrt the designed performance guarantee of an oblivious
scheduler:
Definition
4.1. A bin i  [n] is called saturated upon
the arrival of a new ball t  m, if and only if it has
t-1
(i) &gt; a · opt  (a), where (a) is called the designed
performance guarantee
of the oblivious scheduler.
Let
r  [d], i
r
min{i  [n] :
i
j=1
C
j

r
=1
n

}.
Then, we consider the following partition of the set of bins
[n] into d + 1 groups of (roughly geometrically) decreasing
cumulative capacities:
F
1
{1, . . . , i
1
},
F
r
{i
r-1
+ 1, . . . , i
r
}, r = 2, . . . , d,
F
d+1
{i
d
+ 1, . . . , n}.
Although the cumulative capacity of group F
r
may vary
from
n
2
r
-C
max
to
n
2
r
+
C
max
, for ease of the following computations
we assume that asymptotically
r  [d], C[F
r
]

n
2
r
and C[F
d+1
]

n
2
d
. We denote by
C
min

the capacity of the
smallest bin in F

,   [d + 1].
We now consider the following ideal scheduler that uses
an oblivious polling strategy and an assignment strategy
based on the slowfit rule. This scheduler (we call it
OBL

)
initially discards all the illegitimate bins in the system, using
the knowledge of m. Then first it normalizes the capacity
vector of the remaining bins and afterwards it considers the
grouping mentioned above and adopts the following pair of
strategies:
POLLING:
1  r  d group F
r
gets exactly 1 poll, which
is chosen among the bins of the group proportionally to the
bin capacities. That is,
r  [d], i  F
r
,
IP[bin i  F
r
is a candidate host of a ball]
C
i
C[F
r
] .
The remaining d polls are assigned to the bins of group F
d+1
,
either to the d fastest bins, or according to the polling strategy
of always go left, depending only on the parameters
(c, d) of the problem instance.

ASSIGNMENT: Upon the arrival of a new ball t  [m],
the smallest polled bin from

d
=1
F

(starting from F
1
, to
F
2
, a.s.o.) that is unsaturated gets this ball (slowfit rule).
In case that all the first d polls of a ball are already saturated
, then this ball has to be assigned to a bin of F
d+1
using its remaining d candidates. Within group F
d+1
, either
the minimum post load rule (ie, the bin of minimum load
among the d choices from F
d+1
is chosen, taking into account
also the additional load of the new ball), or the slowfit rule

Observe that this is offline information and thus this decision
can be made at the beginning of the assignment process,
for all the balls of the input sequence.
is applied, depending on the offline parameters (c
, d) of the
problem instance. If all the 2d polled bins are saturated,
then the minimum post load rule is applied among them.
Ties are always broken in favour of smaller bins (ie, slower
machines).
The following theorem gives the performance of
OBL

,
when the additional information of the input size is also
provided offline:
Theorem
2. For lnln n - lnlnln n &gt; d  2, when the
size of the input sequence m  n is given as offline information
,
OBL

has a strict competitive ratio that drops

Proof:
Let  + 1  m be the first ball in the system that
hits only saturated bins by its 2d polls. Our purpose is to
determine the value of a in the designed performance guarantee
(a), so that the probability of ball  +1 existing to be
polynomially small. As stated before, the technique that we
shall employ is a layered induction argument on the number
of balls that are passed to the right of group F
r
, r  [d]. For
the assignment of the balls that end up in group F
d+1
we
use a slightly modified version of the always go left scheduler
of [18] that gives an upper bound on the maximum load
in group F
d+1
(we denote this by
L
max
[F
d+1
]). This upper
bound on
L
max
[F
d+1
] holds with high probability. This assignment
is only used when it produces a smaller maximum
load than the brute assignment of all the balls ending up in
F
d+1
to the d fastest bins of the group.
We shall consider a notion of time that corresponds to the
assignments of newly arrived balls into the system: At time
t  m, the t
th
ball of the input sequence is thrown into the
system and it has to be immediately assigned to one of its
2d candidates.
Consider the polls on behalf of a ball to be ordered according
to the groups from which they are taken. Observe then
that each ball t   is assigned to the first unsaturated bin
that it hits from the first d groups, or to a bin in group F
d+1
.
Thus,
[d+1], each ball that has been assigned to group
F

up to (and including) ball  , has definitely failed to hit
an unsaturated bin in all the groups F
1
, . . . , F
-1
. For any
ball t  m and   [d], let Q
t
() denote the number of balls
that have been assigned to group F

up to time t (ie, right
after the assignment of the t
th
ball), while ~
Q

the cost of

Proof:
The cost of

up to time  is upper-bounded
by max
{L
max
[F

], (a + 1) · opt} since in the first d groups
no saturated bin ever gets another ball and all the bins are
legitimate. We choose a so that the cost in the first d groups
is at least as large as
L
max
[F
d+1
] (whp), given the upper
bound ^
Q(d) on the number of balls that end up in the last
group. Thus the probability of  + 1 existing will be then
polynomially small because at least one poll in F
d+1
will
have to be unsaturated whp. This then implies the claimed
upper bound on the performance of
OBL

. Due to lack of
space, the complete proof of this lemma is presented in the
full version of the paper.
Combining the statements of all these technical lemmas, we
conclude with the desired bound on the competitive ratio of
OBL

.
A COMPETITIVE HAPS SCHEDULER
In the previous section we have proposed a hops scheduler
that is based on the knowledge of the size of the input
sequence and then assures that its own performance is never
worse than (a + 1)opt, whp. In this section we propose a
haps
scheduler (call it
ADAPT ) whose main purpose is
to "guess" the value opt of the optimum offline cost by a
classical guessing argument and then let
OBL

do the rest
of the assignments. This approach is in complete analogy
with the online schedulers of the Related Machines-Full
Information problem (see [6], pp. 208-210). The only difference
is that
OBL

has a performance which holds whp,
and this is why the final result also holds whp.
A significant difficulty of
ADAPT is exactly this guessing
mechanism that will have to be based on the limited information
provided to each of the new tasks. Our goal is not to
assume that any kind of additional information (eg, global
environment variables) is provided to the balls, other than
the capacity vector and the current loads of each ball's candidates
.
ADAPT sacrifices one of the available polls per
ball, in order to create such a good guessing mechanism.
Of course, a different approach that would be based on the
outcome of some of the polls (eg, a constant fraction of the
polls) in order to estimate a proper online prediction of opt
would be more interesting in the sense that it would not
create a communication bottleneck for the tasks. Nevertheless
, the purpose of
ADAPT is mainly to demonstrate the
possibility of constructing such an adaptive scheduler whose
performance is close to that of
OBL

.
Let's assume that the system now has n + 1 capacitated
bins (
C
min
=
C
1
C
2
· · ·  C
n+1
=
C
max
). Assume also
that each new task is provided with 2d + 1 polls. Fix a
number r &gt; 1. Then an r-guessing mechanism proceeds
in stages: Stage  ( = 0, 1, . . . ) contains a (consecutive)
subsequence of tasks from the input sequence that use the
same prediction

= r


0
for their assignment. We set

0
=
1
C
max
. The following definitions refer to the notions
of eligible and saturated machines upon the arrival of a
new task t  [m] into the system, that are used in a similar
fashion as in [5] where the concept of eligible-saturated
machines was introduced:
Definition
5.1. Suppose that task t  m belongs to stage
.The set of eligible machines for t is
E

i  [n] : 1

while a machine i  [n] is considered to be saturated upon
the arrival of task t, if

.
Notice that the static information of (E

, a

),  = 0, 1, . . .
only depends on the capacity vector c and the number d of
polls per task. Thus it can be easily computed by each of
the tasks, or alternatively it can be provided a priori to all
the tasks as additional offline information.
ADAPT proceeds in phases and works as follows: Upon
the arrival of a new ball t  [m], first the fastest bin in the
system is polled and the stage s(t) to which this ball belongs
is determined, according to the following rule:
s(t) =   IN : r
-1
a
-1
+ 1 &lt; q
t-1
(n + 1)  r

a

+ 1
(obviously for stage 0 only the second inequality must hold).
The remaining 2d polls of task t are taken from group E
s(t)
in a fashion similar to that of
OBL

. The assignment strategy
of
ADAPT is exactly the same with that of OBL

, with
the only difference that whenever the first 2d candidates of
a task are already saturated, then this task is assigned to
the fastest machine in the system, n + 1. If the latter event
causes machine n + 1 to become also saturated, then by the
definition of the stages this task is the last ball of the current
stage and a new stage (with an r times larger prediction)
starts from the next task on.
Lemma
5.1. Suppose that
ADAPT uses r = 9/4.Let
h denote the stage at which the prediction
h
of
ADAPT
reaches opt for the first time.Then the last stage of
ADAPT
is at most h + 1.
Proof:
The case of h = 0 is easy since this implies that
opt = 1/C
max
and then
ADAPT cannot be worse than
OBL

which (having the right prediction) succeeds to assign
all the incoming tasks (but for those that might fit in machine
n +1 without making it saturated) below (a
0
+ 1)
·opt,
whp. So let's consider the case where h  1.
Let E

denote the set of legitimate machines in the system
(ie, E

=
{i  [n + 1] : 1/C
i
opt}). The amount
of work inserted into the system during the whole assignment
process is bounded by C[E

· opt. By definition of
h, r

. Stage h + 1 ends when
machine n + 1 becomes saturated. Let W () denote the
total amount of work assigned during stage , while R()
denotes the amount of remaining work at the end of stage
. We shall prove that the amount of remaining work at the
end of stage h is not enough to make OBL

fail within stage
h + 1.
Observe that at the end of stage h, no machine has exceeded
a load of (a

(by definition

The following theorem is now a straightforward consequence
of the previous lemma:

CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have studied the problem of exploiting limited
online information for the assignment of a sequence of
unit-size tasks to related machines. We have shown that the
oblivious schedulers that perform asymptotically optimally
in the case of identical machines, deteriorate significantly
in this case. We have then determined an adaptive scheduler
that actually mimics the behaviour of an ideal oblivious
scheduler, in order to achieve roughly the asymptotically optimal
performance similar to the case of the identical machines
.
As for further research, the issue of providing only limited
information to online algorithms is critical in many problems
for which an objective is also the minimization of the communication
cost. In this category fall most of the network
design problems. Another interesting line of research would
be the avoidance of communication bottlenecks for such limited
information online algorithms. Additionally, it would
be very interesting to study the case of tasks of arbitrary
sizes being injected into the system.
